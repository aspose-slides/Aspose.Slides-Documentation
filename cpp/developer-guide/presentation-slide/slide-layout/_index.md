Each slide has unique Id and Layout slides are maintained inside presentation Masters. One can access the Layout slide either by Type or by Name. Aspose.Slides for C++ allows developers to add new Layout slides in the presentation. To add a Layout Slide, please follow the steps below:

1. Add an empty slide with a newly added Layout slide.
1. Finally, write the presentation file using the Presentation object.
