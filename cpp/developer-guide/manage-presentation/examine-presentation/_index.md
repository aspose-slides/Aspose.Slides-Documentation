The [PresentationInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation_info) class contains most of the methods needed for operations here.

## **Checking a Presentation Format**

Before working on a presentation, you may want to find out what format (PPT, PPTX, ODP, and others) the presentation is in at the moment.

You can check a presentation's format without loading the presentation. See this sample code:

``` cpp
auto info = PresentationFactory::get_Instance()->GetPresentationInfo(u"pres.pptx");
// PPTX
Console::WriteLine(ObjectExt::ToString(info->get_LoadFormat()));

auto info2 = PresentationFactory::get_Instance()->GetPresentationInfo(u"pres.ppt");
// PPT
Console::WriteLine(ObjectExt::ToString(info2->get_LoadFormat()));

auto info3 = PresentationFactory::get_Instance()->GetPresentationInfo(u"pres.odp");
// ODP
Console::WriteLine(ObjectExt::ToString(info3->get_LoadFormat()));
```

## **Getting the Properties of a Presentation**

This sample code in C++ shows you how to get a presentation’s properties (information about the presentation):

``` cpp
auto info = PresentationFactory::get_Instance()->GetPresentationInfo(u"pres.pptx");
auto props = info->ReadDocumentProperties();
Console::WriteLine(ObjectExt::ToString(props->get_CreatedTime()));
Console::WriteLine(props->get_Subject());
Console::WriteLine(props->get_Title());
// .. 
```

## **Updating the Properties of a Presentation**

Aspose.Slides provides the [PresentationInfo::UpdateDocumentProperties()](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation_info#ac9fce3667003cdb8bf05816c589a6f88) method that allows you to make changes to a presentation’s properties.

This sample code shows you how to edit the properties for a presentation in C++:

``` cpp
auto info = PresentationFactory::get_Instance()->GetPresentationInfo(u"pres.pptx");

auto props = info->ReadDocumentProperties();
props->set_Title(u"My title");
info->UpdateDocumentProperties(props);
```
