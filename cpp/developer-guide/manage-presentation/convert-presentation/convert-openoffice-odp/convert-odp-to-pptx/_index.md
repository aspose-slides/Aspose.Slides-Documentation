Aspose.Slides for .NET offers Presentation class that represents a presentation file. [**Presentation**](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class can now also access ODP through Presentation constructor when the object is instantiated. The following example shows how to convert a ODP Presentation into PPTX Presentation.

``` cpp
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = GetDataPath();

// Open the ODP file
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(dataDir + u"AccessOpenDoc.odp");

// Saving the ODP presentation to PPTX format
pres->Save(dataDir + u"AccessOpenDoc_out.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
```
