## **Presentation to XPS Conversion**
### **About XPS**
The [XML Parser Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Paper_Specification) is a page description language and a fixed-document format originally developed by Microsoft. Like PDF, XPS is a fixed-layout document format designed to preserve document fidelity and provide device-independent document appearance.
### **Convert Presentation to XPS with Aspose.Slides**
Any presentation document that can be loaded by Aspose.Slides for C++ can be converted to XPS format. Aspose.Slides for C++ uses the high-fidelity page layout and rendering engine to produce output in fixed-layout XPS document format. It is worth-mentioning that Aspose.Slides for C++ directly generates XPS without depending upon the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) classes that are packaged with C++ Framework 3.5 hence allowing Aspose.Slides for C++ to produce XPS documents on machines running C++ Framework versions earlier than version 3.5. You can learn about exporting the presentation documents to XPS documents through Aspose.Slides for C++ in [this topic](/slides/cpp/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-microsoft-xps-document/).
