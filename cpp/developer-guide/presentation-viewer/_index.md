## **Generate SVG Image from Slide**
Aspose.Slides for C++ is used to create presentation files, complete with slides. These slides can be viewed by opening presentations using Microsoft PowerPoint. But sometimes, developers may also need to view slides as SVG images in their favorite image viewer. In such cases, Aspose.Slides for C++ lets you export an individual slide to an SVG image. This article describes how to use this feature. To generate an SVG image from any desired slide with Aspose.Slides.Pptx for C++, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of the [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
- Obtain the desired slide's reference by using its ID or index.

## **Generate SVG with Custom Shape IDS**
Now Aspose.Slides for C++ can be used to generate SVG from slide with custom shape ID. These slides can be viewed by opening presentations using Microsoft PowerPoint. But sometimes, developers may also need to view slides as SVG images in their favorite image viewer. In such cases, Aspose.Slides for C++ lets you export an individual slide to an SVG image.For that purpose ID property has been added to ISvgShape to support custom IDs of shapes in generated SVG.  To implement this feature a CustomSvgShapeFormattingController has been introduced that you can use to set shape ID.
