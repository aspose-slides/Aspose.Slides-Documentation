## **Multiple Paragraphs having Multiple Portions**
An ITextFame object can have one or more Paragraphs (every paragraph is created through a carriage return), that is a collection of IParagraph objects. Furthermore, an IParagraph object can have one or more Portions (a collection of IPortion objects. An IPortion object manages text and its formatting properties. So, it means that IParagraph object has the capacity to handle text with different formatting properties through its underlying IPortion objects.
Please follow the steps below to add TextFrame having 3 paragraphs and 3 portions for each paragraph using Aspose.Slides for C++ :

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Add an IAutoShape of Rectangle type to the slide.
- Access the ITextFrame associated with the IAutoShape.
- Create two IParagraph objects and add it to the IParagraphs collection of the ITextFrame.
- Create three IPortion objects for each new IParagraph (two Portion objects for default Paragraph) and add each IPortion object to the IPortions collection of each IParagraph.
- Set some text for each Portion.
- Apply the desired formatting features to each Portion using different formatting properties exposed by IPortion object.
- Write the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

The implementation of the above steps is given below.

## **Paragraph Bullets in PPTX**
This topic is also the part of the topic series of managing text paragraphs. This page will illustrate that how we can manage paragraph bullets. Bullets are more useful where the something is to be described in steps. Moreover, text looks well organized with the use of bullets. Bulleted paragraphs are always easier to read and understand. We will see that how developers can use this small yet powerful feature of Aspose.Slides for C++. Please follow the steps below to manage the paragraph bullets using Aspose.Slides for C++:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
- Access the desired slide in slide collection using ISlide object.
- Add an autoshape in selected slide.
- Access the TextFrame of the added shape.
- Remove the default paragraph in the TextFrame.
- Create the first paragraph instance using Paragraph class.
- Set the bullet type of the paragraph.
- Set the bullet type to Symbol and the set the bullet character.
- Set the Paragraph Text.
- Set the Paragraph Indent to set the bullet.
- Set the Color of Bullet.
- Set the Height of Bullets.
- Add the created paragraph in TextFrame paragraph collection.
- Add the second paragraph and repeat the process given in steps 7 to 13.
- Save the presentation.

The implementation of the above steps is given below.
