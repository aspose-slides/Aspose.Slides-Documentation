## **Change Text in Placeholder**
Using Aspose.Slides for C++, developers can also find and modify a specific Placeholder present in a slide. In this topic, we are going to demonstrate with the help of an example that how the text contained inside a Placeholder can be replaced or modified using Aspose.Slides for C++. The following two steps will be used to modify text in Placeholder.

Step 1: Create a Slide Containing a Placeholder

First of all, create a presentation file with a slide containing a Placeholder. You can create this presentation either MS PowerPoint. This is just the demonstration of replacing text in a Placeholder, so, you can create this presentation by yourself. This presentation will be used in the next step and the text in its Placeholder will be replaced.

Step 2: Replace Text of the Placeholder

To replace the text of a Placeholder, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Iterate through the Shapes and find the Placeholder shapes.
- Typecast the Placeholder shape to AutoShape and change the text using the TextFrame associated with the AutoShape.
- Write the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

## **Set Prompt Text in Placeholder**
As we know that Standard and pre-built layouts contain placeholders with default text like **Click to add a title** or **Click to add subtitle**. Using Aspose.Slides you can add prompt text manually by accessing the default placeholders.

The code snippet below shows how to use this feature:
