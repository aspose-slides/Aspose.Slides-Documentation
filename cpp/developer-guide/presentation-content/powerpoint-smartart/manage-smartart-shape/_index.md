## **Create SmartArt Shape**
Aspose.Slides for C++ now facilitates to add custom SmartArt shapes in their slides from scratch. Aspose.Slides for C++ has provided the simplest API to create SmartArt shapes in an easiest way. To create a SmartArt shape in a slide, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.

## **Access SmartArt Shape in Slide**
The following code will be used to access the SmartArt shapes added in presentation slide. In sample code we will traverse through every shape inside the slide and check if it is a SmartArt shape. If shape is of SmartArt type then we will typecast that to SmartArt instance.

## **Access SmartArt Shape with Particular Layout Type**
The following sample code will help to access the SmartArt shape with particular LayoutType. Please note that you cannot change the LayoutType of the SmartArt as it is read only and is set only when the SmartArt shape is added.

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class and load the presentation with SmartArt Shape.
- Obtain the reference of first slide by using its Index.
- Traverse through every shape inside first slide.
- Check if shape is of SmartArt type and Typecast selected shape to SmartArt if it is SmartArt.
- Check the SmartArt shape with particular LayoutType and perform what is required to be done afterwards.

## **Change SmartArt Shape Style**
The following sample code will help to access the SmartArt shape with particular LayoutType.

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class and load the presentation with SmartArt Shape.
- Obtain the reference of first slide by using its Index.
- Traverse through every shape inside first slide.
- Check if shape is of SmartArt type and Typecast selected shape to SmartArt if it is SmartArt.
- Find the SmartArt shape with particular Style.
- Set the new Style for the SmartArt shape.
- Save the Presentation.

## **Change SmartArt Shape Color Style**
In this example, we will learn to change the color style for any SmartArt shape. In the following sample code will access the SmartArt shape with particular color style and will change its style.

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class and load the presentation with SmartArt Shape.
- Obtain the reference of first slide by using its Index.
- Traverse through every shape inside first slide.
- Check if shape is of SmartArt type and Typecast selected shape to SmartArt if it is SmartArt.
- Find the SmartArt shape with particular Color Style.
- Set the new Color Style for the SmartArt shape.
- Save the Presentation.
