## **Create Picture Organization Chart**
Aspose.Slides for C++ provides a simple API for creating and PictureOrganization charts in an easy way. To create a chart on a slide:

1. Create an instance of the [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.presentation) class.
1. Obtain a slide's reference by its index.
1. Add a chart with default data along with the desired type (ChartType.PictureOrganizationChart).
1. Write the modified presentation to a PPTX file

The following code is used to create a chart.

``` cpp
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"test.pptx");
auto smartArt = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0)->get_Shapes()->AddSmartArt(0.0f, 0.0f, 400.0f, 400.0f, SmartArtLayoutType::PictureOrganizationChart);
pres->Save(u"OrganizationChart.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
```
