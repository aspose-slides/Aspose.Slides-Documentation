## **Apply Color to Data Points**
You can apply color to data points in the chart using Aspose.Slides for C++. [**IChartDataPointLevelsManager**](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.charts.i_chart_data_point_levels_manager) and **[IChartDataPointLevel](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.charts.i_chart_data_point_level)** classes have been added to get access to properties of data point levels. This article demonstrates how you can access and apply color to data points in a chart.
