## **Set Layout Mode of Chart Plot Area**
Aspose.Slides for C++ provides a simple API to set the layout mode of the chart plot area. Property **LayoutTargetType** has been added to **ChartPlotArea** and **IChartPlotArea** classes. If the layout of the plot area defined manually this property specifies whether to layout the plot area by its inside (not including axis and axis labels) or outside (including axis and axis labels). There are two possible values which are defined in **LayoutTargetType** enum.

- **LayoutTargetType.Inner** - specifies that the plot area size shall determine the size of the plot area, not including the tick marks and axis labels.
- **LayoutTargetType.Outer** - specifies that the plot area size shall determine the size of the plot area, the tick marks, and the axis labels.

Sample code is given below.
