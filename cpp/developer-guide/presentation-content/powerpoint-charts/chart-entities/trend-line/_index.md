## **Add Trend Line**
Aspose.Slides for C++ provides a simple API for managing different chart Trend Lines:

1. Create an instance of the [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
1. Obtain a slide's reference by its index.
1. Add a chart with default data along with the any of desired type (this example uses ChartType.ClusteredColumn).
1. Adding the exponential trend line for chart series 1.
1. Adding a linear trend line for chart series 1.
1. Adding a logarithmic trend line for chart series 2.
1. Adding moving average trend line for chart series 2.
1. Adding a polynomial trend line for chart series 3.
1. Adding a power trend line for chart series 3.
1. Write the modified presentation to a PPTX file.

The following code is used to create a chart with Trend Lines.

- Create an instance of Presentation class
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index
- Create a new chart using AddChart method exposed by Shapes object
