## **Fallback Font**
Fallback font is used when the font specified for text is available in the system, but this font does not contain a necessary glyph. In this case, it is possible to use one of the specified fallback fonts for the glyph replacement.

Aspose.Slides allows to create fallback fonts, add them to fallback fonts collection, set fallback font collection for a certain presentation, remove fallback fonts from presentation, specify the rules to apply fallback fonts and others.

To get familiar with these features, use the following links:
