## **About PDF**
The [Portable Document Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF_Format) is a file format that was created by Adobe System for exchange of documents between different organizations. The purpose of this format was to make it possible that contents of the documents may be represented in such a way that their visual appearance is not dependent of the platform on which it is being viewed.
