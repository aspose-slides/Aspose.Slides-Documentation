## **Support for Legacy code**
In order to use the legacy code developed with Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java versions earlier to 13.x, you need to make some minor changes in your code and the code will work as earlier. All the classes that were present in old Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java under Aspose.Slide and Aspose.Slides.Pptx namespaces are now merged in single Aspose.Slides namespace. Please take a look over the following simple code snippet for creating a Hello World Presentation document in legacy Aspose.Slides API and follow the steps describing how to migrate to new merged API.
