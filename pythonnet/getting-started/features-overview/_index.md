## **Supported Platforms**
The platforms Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET can be used on Windows x64 or x86 and wide range of Linux distributions with Python 3.5 or later installed. There are additional requirements to the target Linux platform:
- GCC-6 runtime libraries (or later)
- Dependencies of .NET Core Runtime. Installing .NET Core Runtime itself is NOT required
- For Python 3.5-3.7: The `pymalloc` build of Python is needed. The `--with-pymalloc` Python build option is enabled by default. Typically, the `pymalloc` build of Python is marked with `m` suffix in the filename.
- `libpython` shared Python library. The `--enable-shared` Python build option is disabled by default, some Python distributions do not contain the `libpython` shared library. For some linux platforms, the `libpython` shared library can be installed using the package manager, for example: `sudo apt-get install libpython3.7`. The common issue is that `libpython` library is installed in a different location than the standard system location for shared libraries. The issue can be fixed by using the Python build options to set alternate library paths when compiling Python, or fixed by creating a symbolic link to the `libpython` library file in the system standard location for shared libraries. Typically, the `libpython` shared library file name is `libpythonX.Ym.so.1.0` for Python 3.5-3.7, or libpythonX.Y.so.1.0 for Python 3.8 or later (for example: `libpython3.7m.so.1.0`, `libpython3.9.so.1.0`).

If you need support for more platforms, look for the "twin brother" products Aspose.Slides for .NET or Aspose.Slides for Java.

## **Content Features**
Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET allows you to access, modify, or create almost all the items or contents of presentation documents. Go through these details:

|**Feature**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|Master Slides|The master Slides define the layout of the normal slides. Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET allows you to access and modify the Master Slides of presentation documents|
|Normal Slides|With Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET, you can create new slides of different types; you also get to access and modify existing slides in the presentations|
|Cloning / Copying Slides|There are built-in methods provided by Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET that allow you to clone or copy existing slides within a presentation. You also get to use copied and cloned slides from one presentation to another. Since a slide inherits its layout from the master slide, the built-in cloning methods automatically copy the master on cloning|
|Managing Slides sections|Methods to organize slides in different sections inside a presentation|
|Place Holders and Text Holders|You can access the place holders and text holders in a slide. Moreover, you can create a slide with text holders from scratch using the appropriate method|
