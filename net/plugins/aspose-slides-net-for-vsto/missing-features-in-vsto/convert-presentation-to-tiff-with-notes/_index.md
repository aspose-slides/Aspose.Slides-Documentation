TIFF is one of several widely used image formats that Aspose.Slides for .NET supports for converting a presentation with notes to images. You can also generate slide thumbnails in the Notes Slide view. Below are two code snippets that shows how to generate TIFF images of a presentation in Notes Slide view.

The [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation/methods/save) method exposed by [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) class can be used to convert the whole presentation in Notes Slide view to TIFF. You can also generate a slide thumbnail in Notes Slide view for individual slides.
## **Example**

``` 

  //Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a presentation file

 Presentation pres = new Presentation("Conversion.pptx");

 //Saving the presentation to TIFF notes

 pres.Save("ConvertedwithNotes.tiff", SaveFormat.TiffNotes);

```
