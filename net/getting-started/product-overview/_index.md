## **Declaration**
All Aspose .NET components require the Full Trust permission set. The reason: Aspose .NET components need top privileges to access registry settings, system files, and virtual directories to execute certain operations like parsing of fonts and similar tasks. Moreover, Aspose .NET Components are based on the core .NET system classes, which also require the Full Trust permission set in many cases. 

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In a case involving NET 2.0, that security level applies these constraints:

- OleDbPermission is not available. This means you cannot use the ADO.NET managed OLE DB data provider to access databases.
- EventLogPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the Windows event log.
- ReflectionPermission is not available. This means you cannot use reflection.
- RegistryPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the registry.
- WebPermission is restricted. This means your application can only communicate with an address or the range of addresses that you defined in the <trust> element.
- FileIOPermission is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application's virtual directory hierarchy.

Due to the reasons above, Aspose .NET components can only be used on servers that grant the Full Trust permission set.
