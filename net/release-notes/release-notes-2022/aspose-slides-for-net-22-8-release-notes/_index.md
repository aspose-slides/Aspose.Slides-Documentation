* [SlideShowSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/) class - represents the slide show settings for the presentation. It has the following properties:
  - [SlideShowType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/slideshowtype)
  - [Loop](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/loop)
  - [ShowNarration](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/shownarration)
  - [ShowAnimation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/showanimation)
  - [PenColor](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/pencolor)
  - [Slides](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/slides)
  - [UseTimings](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideshowsettings/usetimings)
* [BrowsedAtKiosk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/browsedatkiosk) class - represents browsed at a kiosk (full screen) settings.

Here is an example of setting "presented by a speaker" mode of a slide show:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    pres.SlideShowSettings.SlideShowType = new PresentedBySpeaker();
    pres.Save("pres.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

Settings "browsed by individual" mode: 

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    BrowsedByIndividual browsedByIndividual = new BrowsedByIndividual {ShowScrollbar = true};
    pres.SlideShowSettings.SlideShowType = browsedByIndividual;
    pres.Save("pres.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

### Animation Effect.Sound property added ###

Embedded effect of the sound support was added - [Effect.Sound](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.animation/effect/sound/) property. 

``` csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("demo.pptx"))
{
    ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
    
    // Gets the effects sequence for the slide
    ISequence effectsSequence = slide.Timeline.MainSequence;
       
    foreach (IEffect effect in effectsSequence)
    {
        if (effect.Sound == null)
            continue;
        
        // Extracts the effect sound in byte array
        byte[] audio = effect.Sound.BinaryData;
    }
}
