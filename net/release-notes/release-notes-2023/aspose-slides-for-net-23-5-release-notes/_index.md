## Public API Changes ##

## AfterAnimationType enum, Effect.AfterAnimationType and Effect.AfterAnimationColor has been added ##

A new AfterAnimationType enum has been added. It represents the after animation type of an animation effect and can be used with Effect.AfterAnimationType and Effect.AfterAnimationColor:

``` csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("demo.pptx"))
{
    // Get the first effect of the first slide.
    IEffect firstSlideEffect = presentation.Slides[0].Timeline.MainSequence[0];
    
    // Change the effect After animation to "Hide on Next Mouse Click"
    firstSlideEffect.AfterAnimationType = AfterAnimationType.HideOnNextClick;
}
```

Example how to use Effect.AfterAnimationColor combined with AfterAnimationType 

``` csharp 
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("demo.pptx"))
{
    // Get the first effect of the first slide.
    IEffect firstSlideEffect = presentation.Slides[0].Timeline.MainSequence[0];

    // Change the effect After animation type to "Color"
    firstSlideEffect.AfterAnimationType = AfterAnimationType.Color;

    // Set the effect After animation color.
    firstSlideEffect.AfterAnimationColor.Color = Color.Blue;
}
```

## DataLabelCollection.LeaderLinesFormat has been added, DataLabelCollection.LeaderLinesColor declared as obsollete ##

To allow format the chart's leader lines a new property LeaderLinesFormat has been added to DataLabelCollection. This is how it can be formatted:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    IChart chart = (IChart) pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0];
    IChartSeriesCollection series = chart.ChartData.Series;
    IDataLabelCollection labels = series[0].Labels;
        ///
    labels.LeaderLinesFormat.Line.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
    labels.LeaderLinesFormat.Line.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.FromArgb(255, 255, 0, 0);
}
```

DataLabelCollection.LeaderLinesColor declared as obsollete and will be removed after release of version 23.8.

## LowCode.ForEach for shape, paragraph and portion now support include notes ##

LowCode.ForEach for shape, paragraph and portion now suppor overrides to include notes. That is represented as a boolean flag that indicates whether NotesSlides should be included in processing.

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    ForEach.Portion(pres, true, (portion, para, slide, index) =>
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine($"{portion.Text}, index: {index}");
    });
} 
```
