## Overview
Aspose.Slides for .NET provides four overloads methods for the printing of the presentations. These methods are flexible enough to print the presentation to the default printer or to any of the available printers with customized settings. You only need to select the appropriate print method according to the requirement.
## **Print to Default Printer**
Printing of the presentation to the default printer is quite simple in Aspose.Slides for .NET. Perform the following steps in order to print the presentation to default printer:

1. Create an instance of [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class to load a presentation that is to be printed
1. Call the [Print method](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides.ipresentation/print/methods/1) with no parameters as exposed by the Presentation object

In the example given below, we have call the Print method with no parameters.

## **Print to Specific Printer**
Printing of the presentation to the specific printer requires the name of the printer as a parameter to the [**Print**](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides.ipresentation/print/methods/1) method of the [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation). Perform the following steps in order to print the presentation to the desired printer:
