## **Add Slide to Presentation**
Before talking about adding slides to the presentation files, let us discuss some facts about the slides. Each PowerPoint presentation file contains Master / Layout slide and other Normal slides. It means that a presentation file contains at least one or more slides. It is important to know that presentation files without slides are not supported by Aspose.Slides for .NET. Each slide has a unique Id and all the Normal Slides are arranged in an order specified by the zero based index. Aspose.Slides for .NET allows developers to add empty slides to their presentation. To add an empty slide in the presentation, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
- Instantiate [ISlideCollection](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides/islidecollection) class by setting a reference to the Slides (collection of content Slide objects) property exposed by the Presentation object.
- Add an empty slide to the presentation at the end of the content slides collection by calling the AddEmptySlide methods exposed by ISlideCollection object
- Do some work with the newly added empty slide.
- Finally, write the presentation file using the [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) object.
