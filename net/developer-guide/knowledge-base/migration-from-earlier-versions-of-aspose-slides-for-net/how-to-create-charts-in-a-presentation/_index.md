In order to use the legacy code developed with Aspose.Slides for .NET versions earlier to 13.x, you need to make some minor changes in your code and the code will work as earlier. All the classes that were present in old Aspose.Slides for .NET under Aspose.Slide and Aspose.Slides.Pptx namespaces are now merged in single Aspose.Slides namespace.
