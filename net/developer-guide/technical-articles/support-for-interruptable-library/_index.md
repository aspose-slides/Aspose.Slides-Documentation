## **Interruptable Library**
Now in Aspose.Slides InterruptionToken struct and InterruptionTokenSource class have been added. These types support interruption of long-running tasks, such as deserialization, serialization or rendering. InterruptionTokenSource represents the source of the token or multiple tokens passed to **ILoadOptions.InterruptionToken**. When ILoadOptions.InterruptionToken is set and this LoadOptions instance passed to the Presentation constructor, any long-running task related to this Presentation will be interrupted when InterruptionTokenSource.Interrupt method will be invoked.

Code snippet below demonstrates interruption of running task.
