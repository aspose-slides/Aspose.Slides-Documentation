## **Resizing Shapes on Slide**
One of the most frequent questions asked by the Aspose.Slides for .NET customers is how to resize shapes so that when Slide size is changed the data does not cut off. This short technical tip shows how to achieve that. 

To avoid shapes disorientation, each shape on the slide needs to be updated according to new slide size.

```c#
 //Load a presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(@"D:\TestResize.ppt");

//Old slide size
float currentHeight = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Height;
float currentWidth = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Width;

//Changing slide size
presentation.SlideSize.SetSize(SlideSizeType.A4Paper, SlideSizeScaleType.DoNotScale);

//New slide size
float newHeight = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Height;
float newWidth = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Width;

float ratioHeight = newHeight / currentHeight;
float ratioWidth = newWidth / currentWidth;

foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
	foreach (IShape shape in slide.Shapes)
	{
		//Resize position
		shape.Height = shape.Height * ratioHeight;
		shape.Width = shape.Width * ratioWidth;

		//Resize shape size if required 
		shape.Y = shape.Y * ratioHeight;
		shape.X = shape.X * ratioWidth;

	}
}

presentation.Save("Resize.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

If there is any table in the slide then above code would not work perfect. In that case, every cell of the table needs to be resized.

{{% /alert %}} 

You need to use following code on your end if you need to re-size the slides with tables. Setting table width or height is a special case in shapes where you need to alter the individual row height and column width to alter the table height and width.

```c#
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("D:\\Test.pptx");

//Old slide size
float currentHeight = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Height;
float currentWidth = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Width;

//Changing slide size
presentation.SlideSize.SetSize(SlideSizeType.A4Paper, SlideSizeScaleType.DoNotScale);
//presentation.SlideSize.Orientation = SlideOrienation.Portrait;

//New slide size
float newHeight = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Height;
float newWidth = presentation.SlideSize.Size.Width;


float ratioHeight = newHeight / currentHeight;
float ratioWidth = newWidth / currentWidth;

foreach (IMasterSlide master in presentation.Masters)
{
    foreach (IShape shape in master.Shapes)
    {
        //Resize position
        shape.Height = shape.Height * ratioHeight;
        shape.Width = shape.Width * ratioWidth;

        //Resize shape size if required 
        shape.Y = shape.Y * ratioHeight;
        shape.X = shape.X * ratioWidth;

    }

    foreach (ILayoutSlide layoutslide in master.LayoutSlides)
    {
        foreach (IShape shape in layoutslide.Shapes)
        {
            //Resize position
            shape.Height = shape.Height * ratioHeight;
            shape.Width = shape.Width * ratioWidth;

            //Resize shape size if required 
            shape.Y = shape.Y * ratioHeight;
            shape.X = shape.X * ratioWidth;

        }

    }
}

foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    foreach (IShape shape in slide.Shapes)
    {
        //Resize position
        shape.Height = shape.Height * ratioHeight;
        shape.Width = shape.Width * ratioWidth;

        //Resize shape size if required 
        shape.Y = shape.Y * ratioHeight;
        shape.X = shape.X * ratioWidth;
        if (shape is ITable)
        {
            ITable table = (ITable)shape;
            foreach (IRow row in table.Rows)
            {
                row.MinimalHeight = row.MinimalHeight * ratioHeight;
                //   row.Height = row.Height * ratioHeight;
            }
            foreach (IColumn col in table.Columns)
            {
                col.Width = col.Width * ratioWidth;

            }
        }

    }
}

presentation.Save("D:\\Resize.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
