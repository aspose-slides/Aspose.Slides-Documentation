## **Purpose**
Performance is often the first critical factor when choosing a component. This article measures the performance of Aspose.Slides for C++ and VSTO 2008. The simple tests are conducted across the similar operating system, hardware components, and configurations. 


This article presents performance measurements for products including **Aspose.Slides for C++** and **VSTO 2008**. Performance estimates presented here are intended to help you understand what to expect from different components in some commonly used scenarios under similar configurations on commodity hardware running widely used operating systems. Naturally, your application performance depends on your data, data access patterns, cache size, other configuration parameters, operating system and hardware etc. The benchmark aims to illustrate how the components perform under minimum hardware conditions, the faster the hardware, the faster the tasks will be processed by the components.

Benchmarks provide guidelines and help to set basic operational expectations. The topic shows benchmark tes ts that have been performed against Aspose.Slides for C++ and VSTO 2008 . The Performance Measures *{*} allow even novice users to benchmark the performance of the component they are using. The tests will *{*} allow you to objectively benchmark a component using a variety of different speed tests. All the tasks are common and carefully chosen exploring the relevant features to make sure that both the components may complete the tasks with ease. Moreover, the APIs to perform a test by each component are carefully chosen and selected to get the best possible results that a component can produce while evaluating its performance and all the tasks were implemented twice / thrice to better judge the figures.

## **Testing Methodology**
All the performance tests were conducted on a common hardware and operating system combinations, without customized configuration, tuning or any other performance enhancing techniques. All tests were run with the component insta llations on the same system those were otherwise quiescent. To get accurate readings, we performed all the tasks twice / thrice at a time to better evaluate a component and to get accurate readings.

The exe cution time is taken after deploying the applications as it gives the exact time, otherwise time calculation in the Visual Studio Debugger results in unexpected and unrealistic results. For example, if the code snippets in the attached source code are executed in Visual Studio Debugger 3 – 5 times, there will be a marginal difference of the results in every attempt thus creating a situation with no conclusion.
