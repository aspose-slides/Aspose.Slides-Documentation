## **Interruptable Library**

In [Aspose.Slides 18.4](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/cpp/release-notes/2018/aspose-slides-for-cpp-18-4-release-notes/), we introduced the [InterruptionToken](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontoken/) and [InterruptionTokenSource](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/) classes. They allow you to interrupt long-running tasks such as deserialization, serialization, and rendering.

- [InterruptionTokenSource](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/) is the source of the token(s) passed to [ILoadOptions::set_InterruptionToken](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/loadoptions/set_interruptiontoken/).
- When [ILoadOptions::set_InterruptionToken](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/loadoptions/set_interruptiontoken/) is set and the [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/loadoptions/) instance is passed to the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/presentation/) constructor, invoking [InterruptionTokenSource::Interrupt()](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/interrupt/) interrupts any long-running task associated with that [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/presentation/).

The following code snippet demonstrates interrupting a running task:

```cpp
void Run(Action<SharedPtr<IInterruptionToken>> action, SharedPtr<IInterruptionToken> token)
{
    auto threadFunction = std::function<void()>([&action, &token]() -> void
    {
        action(token);
    });

    auto thread = System::MakeObject<Threading::Thread>(threadFunction);
    thread->Start();
}

void Run()
{
    String dataDir = GetDataPath();

    auto function = std::function<void(SharedPtr<IInterruptionToken> token)> ([&dataDir](SharedPtr<IInterruptionToken> token) -> void
    {
        auto options = System::MakeObject<LoadOptions>();
        options->set_InterruptionToken(token);

        auto presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(dataDir + u"sample.pptx", options);
        presentation->Save(dataDir + u"sample.ppt", Export::SaveFormat::Ppt);
    });

    auto action = System::Action<SharedPtr<IInterruptionToken>>(function);
    auto tokenSource = System::MakeObject<InterruptionTokenSource>();
    
    Run(action, tokenSource->get_Token()); // run the action in a separate thread
    Threading::Thread::Sleep(5000);        // timeout
    tokenSource->Interrupt();              // stop conversion
}
```

## **FAQ**

**Q: What is the purpose of the Aspose.Slides interrupt library?**

It provides a mechanism to interrupt long-running operations—such as loading, saving, or rendering presentations—before they complete. This is useful when processing time must be limited or the task is no longer needed.

**Q: What is the difference between [InterruptionToken](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontoken/) and [InterruptionTokenSource](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/)?**

- `InterruptionToken` is passed to the Aspose.Slides API and checked during long-running operations.
- `InterruptionTokenSource` is used in your code to create tokens and trigger interruptions by calling `Interrupt()`.

**Q: What tasks can be interrupted?**

Any Aspose.Slides task that accepts an [InterruptionToken](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontoken/)—such as loading a presentation with `Presentation(path, loadOptions)` or saving with `Presentation::Save(...)`—can be interrupted.

**Q: Does interruption happen immediately?**

No. Interruption is cooperative: the operation periodically checks the token and stops as soon as it detects that [Interrupt()](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/interrupt/) has been called.

**Q: What happens if I call [Interrupt()](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/interrupt/) after a task has already completed?**

Nothing—the call has no effect if the corresponding task has already completed.

**Q: Can I reuse the same [InterruptionTokenSource](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/) for multiple tasks?**

Yes—but after you call [Interrupt()](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides/interruptiontokensource/interrupt/) on that source, all tasks using its tokens will be interrupted. Use separate token sources to manage tasks independently.
