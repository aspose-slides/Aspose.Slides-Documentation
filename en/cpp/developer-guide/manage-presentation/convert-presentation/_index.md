## **PPT to PPTX Conversion**
### **About PPT to PPTX Conversion**
Aspose.Slides now supports converting PPT to PPTX.
### **Convert PPT to PPTX with Aspose.Slides**
Aspose.Slides for C++ provides partial support for converting PPT document file format presentations to PPTX file format presentations. As the support for the mentioned presentation conversion feature has justbeen introduced in Aspose.Slides for C++, so at the moment it has got the limited capability and works only for the simple form of presentations. The main advantage that Aspose.Slides for C++ API library provides for converting PPT presentation to PPTX format presentation is the ease of using API in achieving the desired goal. Please proceed to this [link](/slides/cpp/convert-presentation/) to code snippets section for further details.The following section clearly illustrates which of features are supported and unsupported while converting PPT format presentations to PPTX format presentations.

## **Presentation to PDF Conversion**
### **About PDF**
The [Portable Document Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) is a file format that was created by Adobe System for exchange of documents between different organizations. The purpose of this format was to make it possible that contents of the documents may be represented in such a way that their visual appearance is not dependent of the platform on which it is being viewed.
### **PDF in Aspose.Slides for C++**
[PDF ](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/)is a file format that was created by Adobe System for exchange of documents between different organizations. The purpose of this format was to make it possible that the visual appearance of the document contents is not dependent of the platform on which it is being viewed. 

Any presentation document that can be loaded into Aspose.Slides for C++ can be converted to PDF document. You can export the presentation documents to PDF directly using Aspose.Slides for C++ component only. You do not need any other third party libraries or Aspose.PDF component for this purpose.

## **Presentation to XPS Conversion**
### **About XPS**
The [XML Parser Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification) is a page description language and a fixed-document format originally developed by Microsoft. Like PDF, XPS is a fixed-layout document format designed to preserve document fidelity and provide device-independent document appearance.
### **Convert Presentation to XPS with Aspose.Slides**
Any presentation document that can be loaded by Aspose.Slides for C++ can be converted to XPS format. Aspose.Slides for C++ uses the high-fidelity page layout and rendering engine to produce output in fixed-layout XPS document format. It is worth-mentioning that Aspose.Slides for C++ directly generates XPS without depending upon the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) classes that are packaged with C++ Framework 3.5 hence allowing Aspose.Slides for C++ to produce XPS documents on machines running C++ Framework versions earlier than version 3.5. You can learn about exporting the presentation documents to XPS documents through Aspose.Slides for C++ in [this topic](/slides/cpp/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-microsoft-xps-document/).

## **Presentation to TIFF Conversion**
### **About TIFF**
The [Tagged Image File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) which is known for storing multiple images in one document was originally created by Aldus. This format is widely supported by scanning, faxing and other image manipulation applications.
### **Convert Presentation to TIFF with Aspose.Slides**
Any document that can be loaded in Aspose.Slide for C++ can also be converted to TIFF document directly by Aspose.Slides for C++ eliminating requirement of any third party component. Further, you can optionally define the size of the images in the resulting TIFF document. You can find information about exporting the presentation documents to TIFF documents through Aspose.Slides for C++ in [this topic](/slides/cpp/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-tiff/).
