## **Represent Data as Bubble Chart Sizes**
New **get_BubbleSizeRepresentation()** method has been added to **IChartSeries** and **ChartSeries** classes. **BubbleSizeRepresentation** specifies how the bubble size values are represented in the bubble chart. Possible values are: **BubbleSizeRepresentationType.Area** and **BubbleSizeRepresentationType.Width**. Accordingly, **BubbleSizeRepresentationType** enum has been added to specify the possible ways to represent data as bubble chart sizes. Sample code is given below.
