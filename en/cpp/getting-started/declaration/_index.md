All Aspose C++ components require Full Trust permission set. The reason is, Aspose C++ components need to access registry settings, system files other than virtual directory for certain operations like parsing fonts etc. Moreover, Aspose C++ Components are based on core C++ system classes that also require Full Trust permission set in many cases.
