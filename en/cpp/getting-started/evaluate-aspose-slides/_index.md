You can easily download Aspose.Slides for evaluation. The evaluation download is the same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you add a few lines of code to apply the license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.Slides (without a license specified) provides full product functionality, but it inserts an evaluation watermark at the top of the document on open and save, and limits to one slide when extracting the text from presentation slides.

If you want to test Aspose.Slides without the evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day Temporary License. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license)
