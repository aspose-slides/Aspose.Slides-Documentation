## **FAQ**

**Do I need Microsoft PowerPoint installed for conversions and rendering?**

No, PowerPoint is not required; Aspose.Slides is a standalone engine for [creating](/slides/cpp/create-presentation/), modifying, [converting](/slides/cpp/convert-presentation/), and [rendering](/slides/cpp/convert-powerpoint-to-png/) presentations.

**Which fonts are needed for correct rendering?**

In practice, the fonts used in the presentation or proper [substitutes](/slides/cpp/font-substitution/) must be available. To ensure consistent rendering on Linux/macOS, it is advisable to install common font packages.
