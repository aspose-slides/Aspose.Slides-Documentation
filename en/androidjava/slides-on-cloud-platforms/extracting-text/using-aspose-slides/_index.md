## **Introduction**

Aspose.Slides provides a **powerful, high-level API** for extracting text from presentation files on **cloud platforms**, including **PPT, PPTX, and ODP**. Unlike the Open XML SDK—which only supports PPTX and involves complex XML parsing—Aspose.Slides simplifies text extraction, allowing you to focus on integrating the extracted content into your workflows.

## **Fast Text Extraction with GetPresentationText**

To extract text from a presentation, the **Aspose.Slides API** offers the static method [PresentationFactory.getPresentationText](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/presentationfactory/#getPresentationText-java.lang.String-int-). It includes multiple overloads for working with a presentation file or a data stream, capturing text from **slides, master slides, layouts, notes, and comments**. The extracted text is accessed via the [IPresentationText](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/ipresentationtext/) interface.

Example usage:

```java
String filePath = "presentation.pptx";
int mode = TextExtractionArrangingMode.Unarranged;

IPresentationText presentationText = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationText(filePath, mode);
ISlideText[] slideTexts = presentationText.getSlidesText();

for (ISlideText slideText : slideTexts) {
    System.out.println("Slide Text: " + slideText.getText());
    System.out.println("Notes Text: " + slideText.getNotesText());
    System.out.println("Comments Text: " + slideText.getCommentsText());
}
```

## **Modes of Operation for GetPresentationText**

The [getPresentationText](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/presentationfactory/#getPresentationText-java.lang.String-int-) method in [PresentationFactory](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/presentationfactory/) lets you fine-tune text extraction using the [TextExtractionArrangingMode](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/textextractionarrangingmode/) parameter, which controls how text is organized in the output.

**Available Modes:**

- `TextExtractionArrangingMode.Unarranged` – Extracts text in a freeform manner, disregarding the original slide layout.  
- `TextExtractionArrangingMode.Arranged` – Preserves text order according to its placement on each slide.

Usage example:

```java
String filePath = "presentation.pptx";
int mode = TextExtractionArrangingMode.Arranged;

IPresentationText presentationText = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationText(filePath, mode);
ISlideText[] slideTexts = presentationText.getSlidesText();

for (ISlideText slideText : slideTexts) {
    System.out.println("Slide Text (preserving order): " + slideText.getText());
}
```
