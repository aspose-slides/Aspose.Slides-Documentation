## **Overview**

Aspose.Slides for Python allows you to receive warning callbacks for font substitution when a required font isnâ€™t available on the machine during rendering. These callbacks help diagnose issues with missing or inaccessible fonts.

## **Enable Warning Callbacks**

Aspose.Slides for Python provides straightforward APIs for receiving warning callbacks when rendering presentation slides. Follow these steps to configure warning callbacks:

1. Create a custom callback class that implements the [IWarningCallback](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.warnings/iwarningcallback/) class to handle warnings.
1. Set the warning callback using option classes such as [RenderingOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/renderingoptions/), [PdfOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/pdfoptions/), [HtmlOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/htmloptions/), and others.
1. Load a presentation that uses a font not available on the target machine.
1. Generate a slide thumbnail or export the presentation to observe the effect.
