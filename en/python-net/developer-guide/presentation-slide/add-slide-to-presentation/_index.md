## **Overview**

Before adding slides to a presentation, it helps to understand how PowerPoint organizes them. Each presentation contains a master slide, optional layout slides, and one or more normal slides. Every slide has a unique ID, and normal slides are ordered by a zero-based index. This article shows how to use Aspose.Slides for Python to create slides and choose appropriate layouts.

## **Add Slides to Presentations**

Aspose.Slides allows you to append new slides based on existing layout slides. The example below iterates through each layout in the presentation, adds a slide that uses that layout, and then saves the file.

1. Create an instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class.
1. Access the [SlideCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/).
1. For each item in `presentation.layout_slides`, call `add_empty_slide` to append a slide that uses that layout.
1. Optionally modify the newly added slides.
1. Save the presentation as a PPTX file.

```py
import aspose.slides as slides

# Instantiate the Presentation class.
with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Access the slide collection.
    slides = presentation.slides

    for layout_slide in presentation.layout_slides:
        # Add an empty slide to the slide collection.
        slides.add_empty_slide(layout_slide)

    # Do some work on the newly added slides.

    # Save the presentation to disk.
    presentation.save("empty_slides.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
