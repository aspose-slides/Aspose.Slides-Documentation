## **Overview**

Images make presentations more engaging and interesting. In Microsoft PowerPoint, you can insert pictures from a file, the internet, or other sources onto slides. Similarly, Aspose.Slides lets you add images to slides in several ways.

You can use image and presentation I/O operations to convert images between formats. See these pages: convert [image to JPG](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/conversion/image-to-jpg/); convert [JPG to image](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/conversion/jpg-to-image/); convert [JPG to PNG](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/conversion/jpg-to-png/); convert [PNG to JPG](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/conversion/png-to-jpg/); convert [PNG to SVG](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/conversion/png-to-svg/); and convert [SVG to PNG](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/conversion/svg-to-png/).

Aspose.Slides supports working with images in popular formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and others.

## **Add Images Stored Locally to Slides**

You can add one or more images from your computer to a slide in a presentation. The following Python example shows how to add an image to a slide:

```py
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]
    with open("image.jpeg", "rb") as image_stream:
        image = presentation.images.add_image(image_stream)
        slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 10, 10, 100, 100, image)

    presentation.save("presentation_with_image.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Add Images From the Web to Slides**

If the image you want to add to a slide isn’t available on your computer, you can insert it directly from the web.

The following Python example shows how to add an image from a URL to a slide:

```py
import aspose.slides as slides
import urllib2
import base64

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]
    image_data = base64.b64encode(urllib2.urlopen("[REPLACE WITH URL]").read())

    image = presentation.images.add_image(image_data)
    slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 10, 10, 100, 100, image)
    
    presentation.save("presentation.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Add Images to Slide Masters**

A slide master is the top-level slide that stores and controls information—theme, layout, and so on—for all slides beneath it. When you add an image to a slide master, that image appears on every slide that uses that master.

The following Python example shows how to add an image to a slide master:

```py
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    master_slide = slide.layout_slide.master_slide

    with open("image.jpeg", "rb") as image_stream:
        image = presentation.images.add_image(image_stream)
        master_slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 10, 10, 100, 100, image)

    presentation.save("master_with_image.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Set an Image as a Slide Background**

You may want to use an image as the background for a specific slide or multiple slides. For details, see [Set an Image as the Background for a Slide](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/python-net/presentation-background/#set-image-as-background-for-slide).

## **Add SVG to Presentations**

You can insert any image into a presentation using the [add_picture_frame](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shapecollection/add_picture_frame/) method of the [ShapeCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shapecollection/) class.

To create an image object from an SVG, follow these steps:

1. Create an [SvgImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/svgimage/) and add it to the presentation’s image collection.
2. Create [PPImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ppimage/) object from [SvgImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/svgimage/).
3. Create [PictureFrame](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/pictureframe/) object using [PPImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ppimage/).

The following Python sample shows how to add an SVG image to a presentation using these steps:

```py 
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    # Read the content of an SVG file.
    with open("sample.svg", "rt") as image_stream:
        svg_content = image_stream.read()
        # Create an SvgImage object.
        svg_image = slides.SvgImage(svg_content)

        # Create a PPImage object.
        pp_image = presentation.images.add_image(svg_image)

        # Create a new PictureFrame.
        slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 100, pp_image.width, pp_image.height, pp_image)

        # Save the presentation in PPTX format.
        presentation.save("presentation_with_SVG.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Convert SVG to a Set of Shapes**

Aspose.Slides converts SVGs into a set of shapes in a way similar to PowerPoint’s SVG handling.

![PowerPoint Popup Menu](img_01_01.png)

This functionality is provided by an overload of the [add_group_shape](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shapecollection/add_group_shape/) method in the [ShapeCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shapecollection/) class that takes an [SvgImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/svgimage/) as its first argument. 
 
The sample code below shows how to convert an SVG file into a set of shapes.

```py 
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Read the SVG file content.
    with open("sample.svg","rt") as image_stream:
        svg_content = image_stream.read()
        # Create an SvgImage object.
        svg_image = slides.SvgImage(svg_content)

        # Get the slide size.
        slide_size = presentation.slide_size.size

        # Convert the SVG image into a group of shapes and scale it to the slide size.
        presentation.slides[0].shapes.add_group_shape(svg_image, 0, 0, slide_size.width, slide_size.height)

        # Save the presentation in PPTX format.
        presentation.save("shapes_from_SVG.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Add Images as EMF in Slides**

Aspose.Slides for Python lets you insert Enhanced Metafile (EMF) images into presentations.

The following Python example demonstrates this:

```py 
with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]
    with open("image.emf", "rb") as image_stream:
        emf_image = presentation.images.add_image(image_stream)
        slide_size = presentation.slide_size.size
        slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 0, 0, slide_size.width, slide_size.height, emf_image)
    
    presentation.save("presentation_with_EMF.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Replace Images in the Image Collection**

Aspose.Slides allows you to replace images stored in a presentation’s image collection, including those used by slide shapes. This section outlines several approaches to updating images in the collection. The API provides straightforward methods to replace an image with raw byte data, an [IImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/) instance, or another image that already exists in the collection.

Follow these steps:

1. Load the presentation that contains the images using the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class.
1. Load a new image from a file into a byte array.
1. Replace the target image with the new image using the byte array.
1. Alternatively, load the image into an [IImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/) object and replace the target image with that object.
1. Or replace the target image with an image that already exists in the presentation’s image collection.
1. Save the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

```py
def read_all_bytes(file_name):
    with open(file_name, "rb") as stream:
        return stream.read()


# Instantiate the Presentation class that represents a presentation file.
with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:

    # The first way.
    image_data = read_all_bytes("image0.jpeg")
    old_image = presentation.images[0]
    old_image.replace_image(image_data)

    # The second way.
    new_image = slides.Images.from_file("image1.jpeg")
    old_image = presentation.images[1]
    old_image.replace_image(new_image)

    # The third way.
    old_image = presentation.images[2]
    old_image.replace_image(presentation.images[3])

    # Save the presentation to a file.
    presentation.save("output.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
