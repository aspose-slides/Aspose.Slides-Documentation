A well-placed video in a presentation can make your message more compelling and increase engagement levels with your audience. 

PowerPoint allows you to add videos to a slide in a presentation in two ways:

* Add or embed a local video (stored on your machine)
* Add an online video (from a web source such as YouTube).

To allow you to add videos (video objects) to a presentation, Aspose.Slides provides the [IVideo](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ivideo/) interface, [IVideoFrame](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ivideoframe/) interface, and other relevant types. 

## **Create Embedded Video Frame**

If the video file you want to add to your slide is stored locally, you can create a video frame to embed the video in your presentation. 

1. Create an instance of the [Presentation ](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/)class.
1. Get a slide's reference through its index. 
1. Add an [IVideo](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ivideo/) object and pass the video file path to embed the video with the presentation. 
1. Add an [IVideoFrame](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ivideoframe/) object to create a frame for the video.  
1. Save the modified presentation. 

This Python code shows you how to add a video stored locally to a presentation:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation(path + "pres.pptx") as pres:
    with open("Wildlife.mp4", "br") as fileStream:
        video = pres.videos.add_video(fileStream, slides.LoadingStreamBehavior.KEEP_LOCKED)

        # Gets the first slide and adds a videoframe
        pres.slides[0].shapes.add_video_frame(10, 10, 150, 250, video)

        # Saves the presentation to disk
        pres.save(path + "pres-with-video.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

Alternatively, you can add a video by passing its file path directly to the `add_video_frame(x, y, width, height, fname)`  method:

``` python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    sld = pres.slides[0]
    vf = sld.shapes.add_video_frame(50, 150, 300, 150, "video1.avi")
```


## **Create Video Frame with Video from Web Source**

Microsoft [PowerPoint 2013 and newer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/versions-of-powerpoint-that-support-online-videos-2a0e184d-af50-4da9-b530-e4355ac436a9?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) support YouTube videos in presentations. If the video you want to use is available online (e.g. on YouTube), you can add it to your presentation through its web link. 

1. Create an instance of [Presentation ](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/)class
1. Get a slide's reference through its index. 
1. Add an [IVideo](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ivideo/) object and pass the link to the video.
1. Set a thumbnail for the video frame. 
1. Save the presentation. 

This Python code shows you how to add a video from the web to a slide in a PowerPoint presentation:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
from urllib.request import urlopen

def add_video_from_youyube(pres, videoId):
    # Adds a videoFrame
    videoFrame = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_video_frame(10, 10, 427, 240, "https://www.youtube.com/embed/" + videoId)
    videoFrame.play_mode = slides.VideoPlayModePreset.AUTO

    # Loads thumbnail
    thumbnail_uri = "http://img.youtube.com/vi/" + videoId + "/hqdefault.jpg"
    f = urlopen(thumbnail_uri)
    videoFrame.picture_format.picture.image = pres.images.add_image(f.read())


with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    add_video_from_youyube(pres, "s5JbfQZ5Cc0")
    pres.save("AddVideoFrameFromWebSource_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Extract Video From Slide**

Besides adding videos to slides, Aspose.Slides allows you to extract videos embedded in presentations.

1. Create an instance of the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class to load the presentation containing the video. 
2. Iterate through all the [ISlide](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/islide/) objects.
3. Iterate through all the [IShape](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/ishape/) objects to find a [VideoFrame](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/videoframe/). 
4. Save the video to disk.

This Python code shows you how to extract the video on a presentation slide:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

# Instantiates a Presentation object that represents a presentation file 
with slides.Presentation(path + "Video.pptx") as presentation:
    for shape in presentation.slides[0].shapes:
        if type(shape) is slides.VideoFrame:
            type = shape.embedded_video.content_type
            buffer = shape.embedded_video.binary_data
            with open("NewVideo_out." + type[type.rfind('/') + 1:len(type)], "wb") as stream:
                stream.write(buffer)
```

## **FAQ**

**Which video playback parameters can be changed for a VideoFrame?**

You can control the [playback mode](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/videoframe/play_mode/) (auto or on click) and [looping](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/videoframe/play_loop_mode/). These options are available via the [VideoFrame](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/videoframe/) object's properties.

**Does adding a video affect the PPTX file size?**

Yes. When you embed a local video, the binary data is included in the document, so the presentation size grows in proportion to the file size. When you add an online video, a link and a thumbnail are embedded, so the size increase is smaller.

**Can I replace the video in an existing VideoFrame without changing its position and size?**

Yes. You can swap the [video content](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/videoframe/embedded_video/) within the frame while preserving the shape's geometry; this is a common scenario for updating media in an existing layout.

**Can the content type (MIME) of an embedded video be determined?**

Yes. An embedded video has a [content type](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/video/content_type/) that you can read and use, for example when saving it to disk.
