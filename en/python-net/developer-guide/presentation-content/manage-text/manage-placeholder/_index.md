## **Overview**

Placeholders define reserved regions on masters, layouts, and slides—such as title, body, picture, chart, date/time, slide number, and footer—that control where content goes and how it inherits formatting. With Aspose.Slides for Python you can discover placeholders on a slide, its layout, or the master by checking that `shape.placeholder` is not `None`, inspect the `placeholder.type`, and then read or modify the associated content and formatting. The API lets you add new placeholders to a master or layout so they propagate to descendant slides, reposition and resize existing ones, convert a placeholder to a normal shape when you need full control, or remove it to simplify a design. The examples below show how to enumerate placeholders, update text and style, and keep layouts consistent by applying changes at the appropriate level.

## **Change Text in Placeholders**

Using Aspose.Slides for Python, you can find and modify placeholders on slides in a presentation. Aspose.Slides allows you to modify the text in a placeholder.

**Prerequisite:** You need a presentation that contains a placeholder. You can create such a presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint.

This is how to use Aspose.Slides to replace the text in a placeholder:

1. Instantiate the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class and pass the presentation as an argument.
1. Get a reference to the slide by its index.
1. Iterate through the shapes to find the placeholder.
1. Change the text using the [TextFrame](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/textframe/) associated with the [AutoShape](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/autoshape/).
1. Save the modified presentation.

This Python code shows how to change the text in a placeholder:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

# Instantiate the Presentation class.
with slides.Presentation("ReplacingText.pptx") as presentation:
    # Access the first slide.
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    # Iterate through shapes to find placeholders.
    for shape in slide.shapes:
        if shape.placeholder is not None:
            # Change the text in each placeholder.
            shape.text_frame.text = "This is Placeholder"

    # Save the presentation to disk.
    presentation.save("ReplacingText_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Set Prompt Text for a Placeholder**

Standard and prebuilt layouts include placeholder prompt text such as **Click to add a title** or **Click to add a subtitle**. With Aspose.Slides, you can replace these prompts with your own text in the placeholder layouts.

The following Python example shows how to set the prompt text for a placeholder:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("PromptText.pptx") as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    # Iterate through shapes to find placeholders.
    for shape in slide.slide.shapes:
        if shape.placeholder is not None and type(shape) is slides.AutoShape:
            if shape.placeholder.type == slides.PlaceholderType.CENTERED_TITLE:
                text = "Add Title"
            elif shape.placeholder.type == slides.PlaceholderType.SUBTITLE:
                text = "Add Subtitle"

            shape.text_frame.text = text
            print(f"Placeholder with text: {text}")

    presentation.save("PromptText_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Set Image Transparency in a Placeholder**

Aspose.Slides lets you set the transparency of a background image in a text placeholder. By adjusting the picture’s transparency in that frame, you can make either the text or the image stand out, depending on their colors.

The following Python example shows how to set the transparency of a picture background inside a shape:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    auto_shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 10, 10, 100, 100)
    auto_shape.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.PICTURE

    with open("image.png", "rb") as image_stream:
        auto_shape.fill_format.picture_fill_format.picture.image = presentation.images.add_image(image_stream)
        auto_shape.fill_format.picture_fill_format.picture_fill_mode = slides.PictureFillMode.STRETCH
        auto_shape.fill_format.picture_fill_format.picture.image_transform.add_alpha_modulate_fixed_effect(75)
```
