## **Specify Center Gap in Doughnut Chart**
In order to specify the size of the hole in a doughnut chart. Please follow the steps below:

- Instantiate [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class.
- Add doughnut chart on the slide.
- Specify the size of the hole in a doughnut chart.
- Write presentation to disk.

In the example given below, we have set the size of the hole in a doughnut chart.

```py
import aspose.slides.charts as charts
import aspose.slides as slides

# Create an instance of Presentation class
with slides.Presentation() as presentation:

    chart = presentation.slides[0].shapes.add_chart(charts.ChartType.DOUGHNUT, 50, 50, 400, 400)
    chart.chart_data.series_groups[0].doughnut_hole_size = 90

    # Write presentation to disk
    presentation.save("DoughnutHoleSize_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **FAQ**

**Can I create a multi-level doughnut with multiple rings?**

Yes. Add multiple series to a single doughnut chartâ€”each series becomes a separate ring. The ring order is determined by the order of the series in the collection.

**Is an "exploded" doughnut (separated slices) supported?**

Yes. There is an Exploded Doughnut [chart type](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/charttype/) and an explosion property on data points; you can separate individual slices.

**How can I get an image of a doughnut chart (PNG/SVG) for a report?**

A chart is a shape; you can render it to a [raster image](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shape/get_image/) or export the chart to an [SVG image](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shape/write_as_svg/).
