## **Add SmartArt Node**
Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET has provided the simplest API to manage the SmartArt shapes in an easiest way. The following sample code will help to add node and child node inside SmartArt shape.

- Create an instance of [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class and load the presentation with SmartArt Shape.
- Obtain the reference of first slide by using its Index.
- Traverse through every shape inside first slide.
- Check if shape is of SmartArt type and Typecast selected shape to SmartArt if it is SmartArt.
- Add a new Node in SmartArt shape NodeCollection and set the text in TextFrame.
- Now, Add a Child Node in newly added SmartArt Node and set the text in TextFrame.
- Save the Presentation.

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as draw
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.slides.smartart as art

# Load the desired the presentation
with slides.Presentation(path + "AddNodes.pptx") as pres:
    # Traverse through every shape inside first slide
    for shape in pres.slides[0].shapes:

        # Check if shape is of SmartArt type
        if type(shape) is art.SmartArt:
            # Adding a new SmartArt Node
            node1 = shape.all_nodes.add_node()
            # Adding text
            node1.text_frame.text = "Test"

            # Adding new child node in parent node. It  will be added in the end of collection
            new_node = node1.child_nodes.add_node()

            # Adding text
            new_node.text_frame.text = "New Node Added"

    # Saving Presentation
    pres.save("AddSmartArtNode_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```



## **Add SmartArt Node at Specific Position**
In the following sample code we have explained how to add the child nodes belonging to respective nodes of SmartArt shape at particular position.

- Create an instance of `Presentation` class.
- Obtain the reference of first slide by using its Index.
- Add a StackedList type SmartArt shape in accessed slide.
- Access the first node in added SmartArt shape.
- Now, add the Child Node for selected Node at position 2 and set its text.
- Save the Presentation.

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as draw
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.slides.smartart as art

# Creating a presentation instance
with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    # Access the presentation slide
    slide = pres.slides[0]

    # Add Smart Art IShape
    smart = slide.shapes.add_smart_art(0, 0, 400, 400, art.SmartArtLayoutType.STACKED_LIST)

    # Accessing the SmartArt node at index 0
    node = smart.all_nodes[0]

    # Adding new child node at position 2 in parent node
    chNode = node.child_nodes.add_node_by_position(2)

    # Add text
    chNode.text_frame.text = "Sample text Added"

    # save Presentation
    pres.save("AddSmartArtNodeByPosition_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```




## **Access SmartArt Node**
The following sample code will help to access nodes inside SmartArt shape. Please note that you cannot change the LayoutType of the SmartArt as it is read only and is set only when the SmartArt shape is added.

- Create an instance of `Presentation` class and load the presentation with SmartArt Shape.

- Obtain the reference of first slide by using its Index.

- Traverse through every shape inside first slide.

- Check if shape is of SmartArt type and Typecast selected shape to SmartArt if it is SmartArt.

- Traverse through all Nodes inside SmartArt Shape.

- Access and display information like SmartArt Node position, level and Text.

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as draw
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.slides.smartart as art

# Load the desired the presentation
with slides.Presentation(path + "AccessSmartArt.pptx") as pres:
    # Traverse through every shape inside first slide
    for shape in pres.slides[0].shapes:
        # Check if shape is of SmartArt type
        if type(shape) is art.SmartArt:
            # Traverse through all nodes inside SmartArt
            for i in range(len(shape.all_nodes)):
                # Accessing SmartArt node at index i
                node = shape.all_nodes[i]

                # Printing the SmartArt node parameters
                print("i = {0}, text = {1},  level = {2}, position = {3}".format(i, node.text_frame.text, node.level, node.position))
  ```

  


## **Access SmartArt Child Node**
The following sample code will help to access the child nodes belonging to respective nodes of SmartArt shape.

        # Check if shape is of SmartArt type
        if type(shape) is art.SmartArt:
            # Traverse through all nodes inside SmartArt
            for node0 in shape.all_nodes:
                # Traversing through the child nodes
                for j in range(len(node0.child_nodes)):
                    # Accessing the child node in SmartArt node
                    node = node0.child_nodes[j]

                    # Printing the SmartArt child node parameters
                    print("j = {0}, text = {1},  level = {2}, position = {3}".format(j, node.text_frame.text, node.level, node.position))

```

## **Set Custom Position for Child Node in SmartArt**
Now Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET support for setting SmartArtShape X and Y properties. The code snippet below shows how to set custom SmartArtShape position, size and rotation also please note that adding new nodes causes a recalculation of the positions and sizes of all nodes.

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as draw
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.slides.smartart as art

# Load the desired the presentation
with slides.Presentation(path + "AccessChildNodes.pptx") as pres: 
	smart = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_smart_art(20, 20, 600, 500, art.SmartArtLayoutType.ORGANIZATION_CHART)

	# Move SmartArt shape to new position
	node = smart.all_nodes[1]
	shape = node.shapes[1]
	shape.x += (shape.width * 2)
	shape.y -= (shape.height / 2)

	# Change SmartArt shape's widths
	node = smart.all_nodes[2]
	shape = node.shapes[1]
	shape.width += (shape.width / 2)

	# Change SmartArt shape's height
	node = smart.all_nodes[3]
	shape = node.shapes[1]
	shape.height += (shape.height / 2)

	# Change SmartArt shape's rotation
	node = smart.all_nodes[4]
	shape = node.shapes[1]
	shape.rotation = 90

	pres.save("SmartArt.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

# Creating a presentation instance
with slides.Presentation(path + "AssistantNode.pptx") as pres: 
    # Traverse through every shape inside first slide
    for shape in pres.slides[0].shapes:
        # Check if shape is of SmartArt type
        if type(shape) is art.SmartArt:
            # Traversing through all nodes of SmartArt shape
            for node in shape.all_nodes:
                tc = node.text_frame.text
                # Check if node is Assitant node
                if node.is_assistant:
                    # Setting Assitant node to false and making it normal node
                    node.is_assistant = False
    # save Presentation
    pres.save("ChangeAssitantNode_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
