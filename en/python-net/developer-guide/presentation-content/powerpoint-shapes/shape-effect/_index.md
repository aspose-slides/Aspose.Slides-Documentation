While effects in PowerPoint can be used to make a shape stand out, they differ from [fills](/slides/python-net/shape-formatting/#gradient-fill) or outlines. Using PowerPoint effects, you can create convincing reflections on a shape, spread a shape's glow, etc.

* PowerPoint provides six effects that can be applied to shapes. You can apply one or more effects to a shape. 

* Some combinations of effects look better than others. For this reason, PowerPoint options under **Preset**. The Preset options are essentially a known good-looking combination of two or more effects. This way, by selecting a preset, you won't have to waste time testing or combining different effects to find a nice combination.

Aspose.Slides provides properties and methods under the [EffectFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/effectformat/) class that allow you to apply the same effects to shapes in PowerPoint presentations.

## **Apply Shadow Effect**

This Python code shows you how to apply the outer shadow effect (`outer_shadow_effect`) to a rectangle:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as draw

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    shape = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.ROUND_CORNER_RECTANGLE, 20, 20, 200, 150)

    shape.effect_format.enable_outer_shadow_effect()
    shape.effect_format.outer_shadow_effect.shadow_color.color = draw.Color.dark_gray
    shape.effect_format.outer_shadow_effect.distance = 10
    shape.effect_format.outer_shadow_effect.direction = 45

    pres.save("output.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Apply Reflection Effect**

This Python code shows you how to apply the reflection effect to a shape:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as draw

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    shape = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.ROUND_CORNER_RECTANGLE, 20, 20, 200, 150)

    shape.effect_format.enable_reflection_effect()
    shape.effect_format.reflection_effect.rectangle_align = slides.RectangleAlignment.BOTTOM
    shape.effect_format.reflection_effect.direction = 90
    shape.effect_format.reflection_effect.distance = 55
    shape.effect_format.reflection_effect.blur_radius = 4

    pres.save("reflection.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Apply Glow Effect**

This Python code shows you how to apply the glow effect to a shape:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as draw

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    shape = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.ROUND_CORNER_RECTANGLE, 20, 20, 200, 150)

    shape.effect_format.enable_glow_effect()
    shape.effect_format.glow_effect.color.color = draw.Color.magenta
    shape.effect_format.glow_effect.radius = 15

    pres.save("glow.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

## **Apply Soft Edges Effect**

This Python code shows you how to apply the soft edges to a shape:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as draw

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    shape = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.ROUND_CORNER_RECTANGLE, 20, 20, 200, 150)

    shape.effect_format.enable_soft_edge_effect()
    shape.effect_format.soft_edge_effect.radius = 15

    pres.save("softEdges.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
