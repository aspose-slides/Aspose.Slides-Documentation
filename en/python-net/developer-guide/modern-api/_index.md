## **Introduction**

The Aspose.Slides for Python public API currently depends on the following `aspose.pydrawing` types:
- `aspose.pydrawing.Graphics`
- `aspose.pydrawing.Image`
- `aspose.pydrawing.Bitmap`
- `aspose.pydrawing.printing.PrinterSettings`

As of version 24.4, this public API is **deprecated** due to [changes](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-slides-for-python-net-24-4-release-notes/#introducing-a-new-modern-api) in the Aspose.Slides for Python public API.

To eliminate `aspose.pydrawing` from the public API, we introduced the **Modern API**. Methods that use `aspose.pydrawing.Image` and `aspose.pydrawing.Bitmap` are deprecated and will be replaced by their Modern API equivalents. Methods that use `aspose.pydrawing.Graphics` are deprecated, and support for them will be removed from the public API.

Removal of the deprecated API that depends on `aspose.pydrawing` is planned for release **24.8**.

## **Modern API**

The following classes and enums have been added to the public API:

- [`aspose.slides.IImage`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/) — represents a raster or vector image.
- [`aspose.slides.ImageFormat`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/imageformat/) — represents an image file format.
- [`aspose.slides.Images`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/images/) — provides methods to create and work with `IImage`.

A typical usage scenario for the new API looks like this:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    with slides.Images.from_file("image.png") as image:
        pp_image = presentation.images.add_image(image)

    slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 10, 10, 100, 100, pp_image)

    with slide.get_image(drawing.Size(1920, 1080)) as slide_image:
        slide_image.save("slide1.jpeg", slides.ImageFormat.JPEG)
```

## **Replace Old Code with the Modern API**

For an easier transition, the new `IImage` class mirrors the separate APIs of the `Image` and `Bitmap` classes. In most cases, you only need to replace calls to methods that use `aspose.pydrawing` with their Modern API equivalents.

### **Get a Slide Thumbnail**

**Deprecated API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    slide.get_thumbnail().save("slide1.png")
```

**Modern API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    with slide.get_image() as image:
        image.save("slide1.png")
```

### **Get a Shape Thumbnail**

**Deprecated API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:
    shape = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]
    
    shape.get_thumbnail().save("shape.png")
```

**Modern API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:
    shape = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]

    with shape.get_image() as image:
        image.save("shape.png")
```

### **Get a Presentation Thumbnail**

**Deprecated API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:
    thumbnails = presentation.get_thumbnails(slides.export.RenderingOptions(), drawing.Size(1980, 1028))

    for index, thumbnail in enumerate(thumbnails):
        thumbnail.save(f"slide_{index}.png", drawing.imaging.ImageFormat.png)
```

**Modern API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:
    thumbnails = presentation.get_images(slides.export.RenderingOptions(), drawing.Size(1980, 1028))

    for index, thumbnail in enumerate(thumbnails):
        thumbnail.save(f"slide_{index}.png", slides.ImageFormat.PNG)
```

### **Add a Picture to a Presentation**

**Deprecated API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    image = drawing.Image.from_file("image.png")
    pp_image = presentation.images.add_image(image)
    slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 10, 10, 100, 100, pp_image)
```

**Modern API:**

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    with slides.Images.from_file("image.png") as image:
        pp_image = presentation.images.add_image(image)

    slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 10, 10, 100, 100, pp_image)
```

## **API Support for aspose.pydrawing.Graphics Will Be Discontinued**

Methods that use `aspose.pydrawing.Graphics` are deprecated; support for them will be removed from the public API.

The API members that rely on `aspose.pydrawing.Graphics` and will be removed include:
- `aspose.pydrawing.Slide.render_to_graphics(options, graphics)`
- `aspose.pydrawing.Slide.render_to_graphics(options, graphics, scale_x, scale_y)`
- `aspose.pydrawing.Slide.render_to_graphics(options, graphics, rendering_size)`

# **FAQ**

**Why was aspose.pydrawing.Graphics dropped?**

Support for Graphics is being removed from the public API to unify work with rendering and images, eliminate ties to platform-specific dependencies, and switch to a cross-platform approach with [IImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/). All rendering methods to Graphics will be removed.

**What is the practical benefit of IImage compared to Image/Bitmap?**

[IImage](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/) unifies working with both raster and vector images, simplifies saving to various formats via [ImageFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/imageformat/), reduces dependence on pydrawing, and makes code more portable across environments.

**Will the Modern API affect the performance of generating thumbnails?**

Switching from `get_thumbnail` to `get_image` does not worsen scenarios: the new methods provide the same capabilities for producing images with options and sizes, while retaining support for rendering options. The specific gain or drop depends on the scenario, but functionally the replacements are equivalent.
