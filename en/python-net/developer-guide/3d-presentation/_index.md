## **Overview**

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET can create, edit, preserve, and render PowerPoint-style 3D formatting for shapes and text. This article covers 3D effects such as rotation, extrusion, bevels, lighting, material, gradient or picture fills, and 3D text.

{{% alert color="info" title="Note" %}}

This article is about 3D formatting effects on PowerPoint shapes and text. It is not about inserting or editing standalone 3D model files. When you export a slide to an image, PDF, or HTML, Aspose.Slides renders those 3D effects into the exported 2D output.

## **3D Formatting Concepts**

Use the [Shape.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shape/three_d_format/) property to apply 3D formatting to a shape. The property exposes [ThreeDFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/), which controls the 3D scene for that shape.

For text, use the [TextFrameFormat.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/textframeformat/three_d_format/) property. This applies 3D formatting to the text frame instead of the shape body.

The most important properties are:

| Property | What it controls | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| [camera](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/camera/) | Viewpoint, preset camera type, rotation, zoom, and perspective. | Rotate the object in 3D space or match a PowerPoint 3D rotation preset. |
| [light_rig](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/light_rig/) | Light preset, direction, and light rotation. | Change how highlights and shadows appear on the 3D surface. |
| [material](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/material/) | Surface material, such as flat, matte, plastic, or metal. | Make the same geometry look flatter, softer, glossy, or metallic. |
| [extrusion_height](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/extrusion_height/) | How far the shape extends backward from its front face. | Turn a flat shape into a visibly thick 3D object. |
| [extrusion_color](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/extrusion_color/) | Color of the extruded sides. | Make depth visible or coordinate the side color with the front fill. |
| [depth](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/depth/) | Additional 3D depth used by PowerPoint 3D formatting. | Fine-tune depth for shapes or text, especially together with bevel and material settings. |
| [bevel_top](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/bevel_top/) and [bevel_bottom](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/bevel_bottom/) | Raised or rounded edges on the front and back faces. | Add a softened or molded edge instead of a sharp flat face. |
| [contour_color](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/contour_color/) and [contour_width](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/contour_width/) | Outline around the 3D object. | Emphasize the object boundary in rendered output. |

## **Create a 3D Shape**

A shape usually needs four kinds of settings before it looks convincingly 3D:

- Camera settings, because the default front view may hide the extrusion.
- Light settings, because lighting makes the faces and sides readable.
- Material settings, because the surface affects how light is rendered.
- Extrusion or depth settings, because a flat shape needs thickness.

The following example creates a rectangle, adds text to its front face, and applies 3D formatting. The camera rotation values are in degrees, and the extrusion height is 100 points. The example renders the slide to a PNG image at twice its default dimensions and saves the presentation as PPTX.

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing
import aspose.slides as slides

image_scale = 2

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 150, 200, 200)

    shape.text_frame.text = "3D"
    shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].paragraph_format.default_portion_format.font_height = 64

    shape.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.SOLID
    shape.fill_format.solid_fill_color.color = drawing.Color.cornflower_blue

    shape.three_d_format.camera.camera_type = slides.CameraPresetType.ORTHOGRAPHIC_FRONT
    shape.three_d_format.camera.set_rotation(20, 30, 40)
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.light_type = slides.LightRigPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.direction = slides.LightingDirection.TOP
    shape.three_d_format.material = slides.MaterialPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_height = 100
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_color.color = drawing.Color.blue

    with slide.get_image(image_scale, image_scale) as thumbnail:
        thumbnail.save("shape_3d.png")

    presentation.save("shape_3d.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

The rendered slide image shows the rectangle as a thick 3D block:

![Rendered blue 3D rectangle with white 3D text on the front face](img_01_01.png)

## **Rotate a Shape with the Camera**

In PowerPoint, 3D rotation is configured from the 3-D Rotation pane. The X, Y, and Z rotation values correspond to the rotation you set through the camera API.

![PowerPoint 3-D Rotation pane with X, Y, and Z rotation values highlighted](img_02_01.png)

In Aspose.Slides, access the camera through [ThreeDFormat.camera](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/camera/). This example creates a rectangle, selects an orthographic front view, and sets its X, Y, and Z rotations to 20, 30, and 40 degrees, respectively. It configures the shape in memory without saving a file:

```py
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 150, 200, 200)

    shape.three_d_format.camera.camera_type = slides.CameraPresetType.ORTHOGRAPHIC_FRONT
    shape.three_d_format.camera.set_rotation(20, 30, 40)
```

Use the camera when you need to change how the viewer sees the object. It does not change the 2D shape geometry on the slide. It changes the 3D viewpoint used by PowerPoint and by Aspose.Slides when rendering.

## **Add Extrusion and Depth**

Extrusion makes a shape look thick by extending it behind the front face. In PowerPoint, the depth control sets this visible thickness, and the color control sets the color of the side faces.

![PowerPoint depth controls mapped to extrusion color and extrusion height properties](img_02_02.png)

Set [ThreeDFormat.extrusion_height](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/extrusion_height/) for the thickness and [ThreeDFormat.extrusion_color](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/extrusion_color/) for the side color. This example gives a rectangle a 100-point extrusion with purple sides and rotates the camera to reveal its thickness. It configures the shape in memory without saving a file:

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 150, 200, 200)

    shape.three_d_format.camera.camera_type = slides.CameraPresetType.ORTHOGRAPHIC_FRONT
    shape.three_d_format.camera.set_rotation(20, 30, 40)
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.light_type = slides.LightRigPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.direction = slides.LightingDirection.TOP
    shape.three_d_format.material = slides.MaterialPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_height = 100
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_color.color = drawing.Color.purple
```

The [ThreeDFormat.depth](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/depth/) property sets the depth of a 3D shape. The [extrusion_height](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/threedformat/extrusion_height/) property controls the height of the extrusion effect, as shown in this example.

## **Use Gradient or Picture Fills with 3D Effects**

3D formatting is independent of the shape fill. You can apply a solid color, gradient, pattern, or picture fill to the front face and still use the same camera, light, material, and extrusion settings.

This example applies a blue-to-orange gradient to the front face and a dark orange color to the 150-point extrusion. The gradient stops at 0 and 100 mark the start and end of the gradient. The camera rotation values are in degrees. The slide is rendered to a PNG image at twice its default dimensions:

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing
import aspose.slides as slides

image_scale = 2

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 150, 250, 250)

    shape.text_frame.text = "3D Gradient"
    shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].paragraph_format.default_portion_format.font_height = 64

    shape.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.GRADIENT
    shape.fill_format.gradient_format.gradient_stops.add(0, drawing.Color.blue)
    shape.fill_format.gradient_format.gradient_stops.add(100, drawing.Color.orange)

    shape.three_d_format.camera.camera_type = slides.CameraPresetType.ORTHOGRAPHIC_FRONT
    shape.three_d_format.camera.set_rotation(10, 20, 30)
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.light_type = slides.LightRigPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.direction = slides.LightingDirection.TOP
    shape.three_d_format.material = slides.MaterialPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_height = 150
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_color.color = drawing.Color.dark_orange

    with slide.get_image(image_scale, image_scale) as thumbnail:
        thumbnail.save("gradient_3d.png")
```

The rendered output keeps the gradient on the front face and renders the extrusion separately:

![Rendered 3D rectangle with a blue-to-orange gradient fill and orange extrusion](img_02_03.png)

To use a picture fill instead, add the image to the presentation and assign it to the shape fill. This example requires an existing file named "image.jpg" in the working directory. It stretches the picture to fill the rectangle, applies a 150-point extrusion, and sets the camera rotation in degrees. It configures the shape in memory without saving or rendering a file:

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing
import aspose.slides as slides

with open("image.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    image_data = image_file.read()

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 150, 250, 250)

    image = presentation.images.add_image(image_data)

    shape.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.PICTURE
    shape.fill_format.picture_fill_format.picture.image = image
    shape.fill_format.picture_fill_format.picture_fill_mode = slides.PictureFillMode.STRETCH

    shape.three_d_format.camera.camera_type = slides.CameraPresetType.ORTHOGRAPHIC_FRONT
    shape.three_d_format.camera.set_rotation(10, 20, 30)
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.light_type = slides.LightRigPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.direction = slides.LightingDirection.TOP
    shape.three_d_format.material = slides.MaterialPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_height = 150
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_color.color = drawing.Color.dark_orange
```

The picture is rendered on the front face, while the extrusion is rendered as the 3D side surface:

![Rendered 3D rectangle with a photo fill on the front face and orange extrusion](img_02_04.png)

## **Apply 3D Formatting to Text**

Shape 3D formatting affects the shape body. Text 3D formatting affects the text frame. This is useful for WordArt-like effects where the letters themselves need extrusion, material, lighting, and camera settings.

The following example creates text with an orange-and-white grid pattern, applies an upward arch, and configures 3D settings through [TextFrameFormat.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/textframeformat/three_d_format/). The extrusion height and depth are in points, and the light rotation is in degrees. The shape fill and outline are hidden so that only the text is visible. The example renders a PNG image at twice the default slide dimensions and saves the presentation as PPTX:

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing
import aspose.slides as slides

image_scale = 2

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 150, 250, 250)
    
    shape.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.NO_FILL
    shape.line_format.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.NO_FILL
    shape.text_frame.text = "3D Text"

    portion = shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].portions[0]
    portion.portion_format.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.PATTERN
    portion.portion_format.fill_format.pattern_format.fore_color.color = drawing.Color.dark_orange
    portion.portion_format.fill_format.pattern_format.back_color.color = drawing.Color.white
    portion.portion_format.fill_format.pattern_format.pattern_style = slides.PatternStyle.LARGE_GRID

    shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].paragraph_format.default_portion_format.font_height = 128

    text_frame_format = shape.text_frame.text_frame_format
    text_frame_format.transform = slides.TextShapeType.ARCH_UP
    text_frame_format.three_d_format.extrusion_height = 3.5
    text_frame_format.three_d_format.depth = 3
    text_frame_format.three_d_format.material = slides.MaterialPresetType.PLASTIC
    text_frame_format.three_d_format.light_rig.direction = slides.LightingDirection.TOP
    text_frame_format.three_d_format.light_rig.light_type = slides.LightRigPresetType.BALANCED
    text_frame_format.three_d_format.light_rig.set_rotation(0, 0, 40)
    text_frame_format.three_d_format.camera.camera_type = slides.CameraPresetType.PERSPECTIVE_CONTRASTING_RIGHT_FACING

    with slide.get_image(image_scale, image_scale) as thumbnail:
        thumbnail.save("text_3d.png")

    presentation.save("text_3d.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

The text is rendered as curved, extruded 3D lettering:

![Rendered 3D text with an arched WordArt transform, orange pattern fill, and dark extrusion](img_02_05.png)

## **Keep Text Flat on a 3D Shape**

To keep text readable while preserving a shape's 3D appearance, set [TextFrameFormat.keep_text_flat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/textframeformat/keep_text_flat/) through [TextFrame.text_frame_format](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/textframe/text_frame_format/). When the value is `True`, the text stays out of the 3D scene. When it is `False`, the text participates in the scene and follows its 3D orientation.

This setting does not remove the shape's 3D formatting: its camera, lighting, material, and extrusion remain configured through [Shape.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shape/three_d_format/). It is also different from ordinary rotation. [Shape.rotation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shape/rotation/) rotates the shape in the slide plane, while [TextFrameFormat.rotation_angle](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/textframeformat/rotation_angle/) controls the text's custom rotation within its bounding box. Keeping text out of the 3D scene does not reset either of those angles.

The following self-contained example creates a blue rectangle with text and clones it beside the original. Both shapes have the same 3D formatting; only the text setting differs: `False` on the left and `True` on the right. The camera angles are in degrees, and the extrusion height is 40 points. The example saves the presentation as PPTX and renders the comparison slide to PNG at twice its default dimensions.

```py
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 70, 160, 240, 140)

    shape.text_frame.text = "Readable text"
    shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].paragraph_format.default_portion_format.font_height = 28
    shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].paragraph_format.alignment = slides.TextAlignment.CENTER
    shape.text_frame.text_frame_format.anchoring_type = slides.TextAnchorType.CENTER
    shape.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.SOLID
    shape.fill_format.solid_fill_color.color = drawing.Color.cornflower_blue

    shape.three_d_format.camera.camera_type = slides.CameraPresetType.ORTHOGRAPHIC_FRONT
    shape.three_d_format.camera.set_rotation(30, 30, 0)
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.light_type = slides.LightRigPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.light_rig.direction = slides.LightingDirection.TOP
    shape.three_d_format.material = slides.MaterialPresetType.FLAT
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_height = 40
    shape.three_d_format.extrusion_color.color = drawing.Color.royal_blue
    shape.text_frame.text_frame_format.keep_text_flat = False

    flat_text_shape = slide.shapes.add_clone(shape, 400, 160)
    flat_text_shape.text_frame.text_frame_format.keep_text_flat = True

    presentation.save("keep_text_flat.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
    with slide.get_image(2, 2) as image:
        image.save("keep_text_flat.png")
```

On the left, the text follows the 3D orientation. On the right, it stays flat and easier to read. Both rectangles retain the same visible extrusion and 3D orientation.

![Side-by-side 3D rectangles: keep_text_flat is False on the left and True on the right](keep_text_flat.png)

## **Export and Rendering Behavior**

Aspose.Slides preserves 3D formatting when saving to PowerPoint formats such as PPTX. When rendering or exporting to fixed-layout formats, the 3D scene is rasterized or drawn into the output as a 2D result. This applies when you render slides to [PNG](/slides/python-net/convert-powerpoint-to-png/), export to [PDF](/slides/python-net/convert-powerpoint-to-pdf/), export to [HTML](/slides/python-net/convert-powerpoint-to-html/), or generate frames for [video conversion](/slides/python-net/convert-powerpoint-to-video/).

Keep these points in mind:

- Exported images and PDFs are not interactive. The object cannot be rotated by the viewer after export.
- The final appearance depends on the combination of camera, light rig, material, extrusion, fill, and slide scaling.
- If you need to inspect inherited or theme-based formatting values, read the [effective shape properties](/slides/python-net/shape-effective-properties/).
- Some output formats cannot store editable PowerPoint 3D formatting. In those formats, the visual result is rendered rather than preserved as editable 3D settings.

## **FAQ**

**Can Aspose.Slides create interactive 3D presentations?**

Aspose.Slides creates and renders PowerPoint 3D effects for shapes and text. It does not make exported images, PDFs, or HTML pages interactive 3D scenes that a viewer can rotate. In PPTX, the 3D formatting remains editable in PowerPoint where the format supports it.

**What is the difference between a 3D model and a 3D effect?**

A 3D model is a separate 3D object inserted into a presentation. A 3D effect is formatting applied to a regular PowerPoint shape or text, such as rotation, extrusion, bevel, lighting, and material. This article covers 3D effects.

**Which settings are required for a visible 3D shape?**

At minimum, set a camera rotation and either extrusion or depth. In practice, also set a light rig and material so the rendered faces have clear highlights and shadows.

**Can I apply 3D effects to both shapes and text?**

Yes. Use [Shape.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shape/three_d_format/) for the shape body and [TextFrameFormat.three_d_format](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/textframeformat/three_d_format/) for text.

**Will 3D effects appear when exporting to images, PDF, HTML, or video frames?**

Yes. Aspose.Slides renders 3D effects when producing slide images, PDF output, HTML output, and frames used for video conversion. The exported output contains the rendered appearance, not an editable 3D object.

**Can I read the final 3D values after inheritance and theme settings are applied?**

Yes. Use the effective formatting APIs described in [Shape Effective Properties](/slides/python-net/shape-effective-properties/) to read final camera, light rig, bevel, and related 3D values.
