## **Convert PowerPoint to PDF with Notes**

The `save` method in the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class can be used to convert a PPT or PPTX presentation to a PDF with speaker notes. With Aspose.Slides, you simply load the presentation, configure the layout options using the [NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/notescommentslayoutingoptions/) class to include speaker notes, and then save the file as a PDF. The following code snippet demonstrates how to convert a sample presentation to a PDF in Notes Slide view.

```py
with slides.Presentation("sample.pptx") as presentation:

    # Configure PDF options for rendering speaker notes.
    notes_options = slides.export.NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions()
    notes_options.notes_position = slides.export.NotesPositions.BOTTOM_FULL

    pdf_options = slides.export.PdfOptions()
    pdf_options.slides_layout_options = notes_options

    # Save the presentation to PDF with speaker notes.
    presentation.save("output.pdf", slides.export.SaveFormat.PDF, pdf_options)
```
