## **Overview**

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET makes it straightforward to convert PowerPoint presentations to PNG. You load a presentation, iterate through its slides, render each one to a raster image, and save the result as PNG files. This is ideal for generating slide previews, embedding slides in web pages, or producing static assets for downstream processing.

## **Convert Slides to PNG**

This section shows the simplest possible example of converting a PowerPoint presentation to PNG images using Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET.

Go through these steps:

1. Instantiate the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class.
1. Get a slide from the `Presentation.slides` collection (see the [Slide](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slide/) class).
1. Use the `Slide.get_image` method to generate a thumbnail of the slide.
1. Use the `Presentation.save` method to save the slide thumbnail in PNG format.

This Python code shows how to convert a PowerPoint presentation to PNG:

```py
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("presentation.pptx") as presentation:
    for index, slide in enumerate(presentation.slides):
        with slide.get_image() as image:
            image.save(f"slide_{index}.png", slides.ImageFormat.PNG)
```

## **Convert Slides to PNG with Custom Dimensions**

To export slides to PNG at a custom scale, call `Slide.get_image` with horizontal and vertical scale factors. These multipliers resize the output relative to the slide’s original dimensions—for example, `2.0` doubles both width and height. Use equal values for `scale_x` and `scale_y` to preserve the aspect ratio.

This Python code demonstrates the described operation:

```py
import aspose.slides as slides

scale_x = 2
scale_y = scale_x

with slides.Presentation("presentation.pptx") as presentation:
    for index, slide in enumerate(presentation.slides):
        with slide.get_image(scale_x, scale_y) as image:
            image.save(f"slide_{index}.png", slides.ImageFormat.PNG)
```

## **Convert Slides to PNG with Custom Size**

If you want to generate PNG files at a specific size, pass your desired `width` and `height` values. The code below shows how to convert a PowerPoint to PNG while specifying the image size: 

```py
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

size = drawing.Size(960, 720)

with slides.Presentation("presentation.pptx") as presentation:
    for index, slide in enumerate(presentation.slides):
        with slide.get_image(size) as image:
            image.save(f"slide_{index}.png", slides.ImageFormat.PNG)
```
