## **FAQ**

**Does it support PDF conformance levels for archiving and accessibility (PDF/A and PDF/UA)?**

Yes. You can save to PDF with PDF/A-2a/2b/2u, PDF/A-3a/3b, as well as PDF/UA by configuring [PDF export options](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/pdfoptions/).

**Is there a font substitution mechanism and support for custom fonts to ensure correct rendering?**

Yes. The library lets you [load custom fonts](/slides/python-net/custom-font/) and [define fallback rules](/slides/python-net/fallback-font/) so missing glyphs are substituted reliably during conversion and rendering.

**Can I detect whether a file is password-protected without fully opening it?**

Yes. You can [inspect a presentation](/slides/python-net/examine-presentation/) to determine if it requires a password before loading the full document.

**Is Microsoft PowerPoint required for processing and conversions?**

No. Aspose.Slides is a standalone engine; PowerPoint is not needed on the server or workstation.

**Is it safe to process presentations from multiple threads?**

Yes, you can process different documents in parallel in separate threads; just avoid using the same presentation instance concurrently [across threads](/slides/python-net/multithreading/).

Yes. Presentations with macros [are supported](/slides/python-net/presentation-via-vba/), and you can [inspect and manage VBA projects](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.vba/) in those files.

**Can I convert PDF or HTML back into PowerPoint slides?**

Yes. You can [import PDF pages or HTML content](/slides/python-net/import-presentation/) to create or populate slides in a presentation.

**Is XPS export supported, and can I control the quality and content of the XPS output?**

Yes. [Export to XPS](/slides/python-net/convert-powerpoint-to-xps/) is available, and [save options](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/xpsoptions/) allow you to tune output quality and included content.

**Can I convert slides to images and control the output quality?**

Yes. Slides can be [rendered to PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF](/slides/python-net/convert-powerpoint-to-png/) and other formats with fine-grained control over size and quality.

**Are mathematical formulas supported (MathML/MathText) and can they be exported?**

Yes. You can [create and edit mathematical text](/slides/python-net/powerpoint-math-equations/) and [export equations](/slides/python-net/exporting-math-equations/), including to MathML.
