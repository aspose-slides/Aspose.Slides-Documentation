## **Installation Process**
Before running the installation, the setup program checks that:

- WSS 3.0 or MOSS 2007 is installed.
- The user has permission to install SharePoint solutions.
- SharePoint database is online.
- WSS Administration Service is started.
- WSS Timer service is started.

The WSS Administration and Timer services are needed because some setup actions rely on a timer job to propagate to all servers in the server farm.
