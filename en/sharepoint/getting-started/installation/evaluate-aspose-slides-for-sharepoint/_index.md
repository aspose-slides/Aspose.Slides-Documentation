It is the same download for both the evaluation and the paid version of Aspose.Slides for SharePoint. Simply [download Aspose.Slides for SharePoint](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/73/sharepoint-components/aspose.slides-for-sharepoint/default.aspx) from the download page, [install it]() and it will work in the evaluation mode by default. 

Evaluation mode injects an evaluation watermark on each slide into the exported document. When you have purchased a license, simply install the license solution over installed evaluation copy of Aspose.Slides for SharePoint and it will then work in the licensed mode.
