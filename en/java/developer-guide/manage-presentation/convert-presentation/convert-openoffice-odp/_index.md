## **Overview**

[**Aspose.Slides API**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) allows to convert OpenOffice ODP presentation to many types. The API to convert ODP to other types is the same as for PowerPoint types. You may use the following examples to convert ODP, just changing the source file on the ODP presentation file:

- [Convert ODP to HTML](/slides/java/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-html/)
- [Convert ODP to PDF](/slides/java/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-pdf/)
- [Convert ODP to TIFF](/slides/java/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-tiff/)
- [Convert ODP to SWF Flash](/slides/java/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-swf-flash/)
- [Convert ODP to XPS](/slides/java/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-microsoft-xps-document/)
- [Convert ODP to PDF with Notes](/slides/java/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-pdf-notes/)
- [Convert ODP to TIFF with Notes](/slides/java/convert-powerpoint-ppt-and-pptx-to-tiff-with-notes/)

## **FAQ**

**What if the formatting of my ODP file changes after conversion?**

ODP and PowerPoint use different presentation models, and some elements—like tables, custom fonts, or fill styles—may not render exactly the same. It is recommended to review the output and adjust layout or formatting in code if needed.

**Do I need OpenOffice or LibreOffice installed to use ODP conversion?**

No, Aspose.Slides is a standalone library and does not require OpenOffice or LibreOffice to be installed on your system.

**Can I customize the output format during ODP conversion (e.g., set PDF options)?**

Yes, Aspose.Slides provides rich options for customizing the output. For example, when saving to PDF, you can control compression, image quality, text rendering, and more through the [PdfOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/pdfoptions/) class.

**Is Aspose.Slides suitable for server-side or cloud-based ODP processing?**

Absolutely. Aspose.Slides is designed to work in both desktop and server environments, including cloud-based platforms like Azure, AWS, and Docker containers, without any UI dependencies.
