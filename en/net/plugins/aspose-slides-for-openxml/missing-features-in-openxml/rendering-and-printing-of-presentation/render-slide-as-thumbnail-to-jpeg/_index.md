**Aspose.Slides for .NET** is used to create presentation files containing slides. These slides can be viewed by opening presentation files using Microsoft PowerPoint. But sometimes, developers may need to view slides as images using their favorite image viewer. In such cases, Aspose.Slides for .NET help you generate thumbnail images of the slides.

To generate the thumbnail of any desired slide using Aspose.Slides for .NET:

1. Create an instance of the **Presentation** class.
1. Obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index.
1. Get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
1. Save the thumbnail image in any desired image format.

``` csharp

 string FilePath = @"..\..\..\Sample Files\";

string srcFileName = FilePath + "Slide Thumbnail to JPEG.pptx";

string destFileName = FilePath + "Slide Thumbnail to JPEG.jpg";

//Instantiate a Presentation class that represents the presentation file

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(srcFileName))

{

    //Access the first slide

    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];

    //Create a full scale image

    Bitmap bmp = sld.GetThumbnail(1f, 1f);

    //Save the image to disk in JPEG format

    bmp.Save(destFileName, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);

}


```
