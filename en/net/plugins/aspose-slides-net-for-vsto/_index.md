## **What is VSTO?**
VSTO, or Visual Studio Tools for Office, or Microsoft Visual Studio Tools is part of Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET tools suite and supports the Microsoft .NET Framework. It is used by developers to write code connecting Microsoft Office Word, Excel and Outlook applications. Developers using VSTO can employ C# or Visual Basic languages. It is an alternative to Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA.
## **Aspose.Slides for .NET**
Aspose.Slides for .NET is a unique PowerPointÂ® management component that enables .NET applications to read, write and manipulate PowerPoint documents without using Microsoft PowerPoint.

Aspose.Slides for .NET is the first and only .NET component that provides functionality to manage PowerPoint documents within your own applications. As with all Aspose .NET components, Aspose.Slides is written in managed C#, incredibly priced and lightning fast.
