## **VSTO**
Below is the code snippet for adding line shape:

``` csharp

   Slide slide = Application.ActivePresentation.Slides[1];

  slide.Shapes.AddLine(10, 10, 100, 10);

``` 
## **Aspose.Slides**
To add a simple plain line to a selected slide of the presentation, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of Presentation class
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index
- Add an AutoShape of Line type using AddAutoShape method exposed by Shapes object
- Write the modified presentation as a PPTX file

In the example given below, we have added a line to the first slide of the presentation.

``` csharp

   //Instantiate Prseetation class that represents the PPTX

  Presentation pres = new Presentation();

  //Get the first slide

  ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];

  //Add an autoshape of type line

  slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Line, 50, 150, 300, 0);

```
