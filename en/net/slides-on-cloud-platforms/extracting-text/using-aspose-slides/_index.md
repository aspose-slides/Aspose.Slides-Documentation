## **Introduction**

Aspose.Slides provides a **powerful, high-level API** for extracting text from presentation files on **cloud platforms**, including **PPT, PPTX, and ODP**. Unlike the Open XML SDK—which only supports PPTX and involves complex XML parsing—Aspose.Slides simplifies text extraction, allowing you to focus on integrating the extracted content into your workflows.

## **Fast Text Extraction with GetPresentationText**

To extract text from a presentation, the **Aspose.Slides API** offers the static method [PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationText](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentationfactory/getpresentationtext/). It includes multiple overloads for working with a presentation file or a data stream, capturing text from **slides, master slides, layouts, notes, and comments**. The extracted text is accessed via the [IPresentationText](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/ipresentationtext/) interface.

Example usage:

```csharp
string filePath = "presentation.pptx";
TextExtractionArrangingMode mode = TextExtractionArrangingMode.Unarranged;

IPresentationText presentationText = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationText(filePath, mode);
ISlideText[] slideTexts = presentationText.SlidesText;

foreach (ISlideText slideText in slideTexts)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Slide Text: " + slideText.Text);
    Console.WriteLine("Notes Text: " + slideText.NotesText);
    Console.WriteLine("Comments Text: " + slideText.CommentsText);
}
```

## **Modes of Operation for GetPresentationText**

The [GetPresentationText](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentationfactory/getpresentationtext/) method in [PresentationFactory](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentationfactory/) lets you fine-tune text extraction using the [TextExtractionArrangingMode](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/textextractionarrangingmode/) parameter, which controls how text is organized in the output.

**Available Modes:**

- `TextExtractionArrangingMode.Unarranged` – Extracts text in a freeform manner, disregarding the original slide layout.  
- `TextExtractionArrangingMode.Arranged` – Preserves text order according to its placement on each slide.

Usage example:

```csharp
string filePath = "presentation.pptx";
TextExtractionArrangingMode mode = TextExtractionArrangingMode.Arranged;

IPresentationText presentationText = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationText(filePath, mode);
ISlideText[] slideTexts = presentationText.SlidesText;

foreach (ISlideText slideText in slideTexts)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Slide Text (preserving order): " + slideText.Text);
}
```
