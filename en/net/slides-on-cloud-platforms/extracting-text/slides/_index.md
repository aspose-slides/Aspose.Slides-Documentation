# Extracting Text from PPT, PPTX, and ODP – Slides

Aspose.Slides provides a **powerful, high-level API** for extracting text from presentation files, including **PPT, PPTX, and ODP**. Unlike the Open XML SDK—which only supports PPTX and involves complex XML parsing—Aspose.Slides simplifies text extraction, allowing you to focus on integrating the extracted content into your workflows.

## Fast Text Extraction with PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationText

To extract text from a presentation, the **Aspose.Slides API** offers the static method `PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationText`. It includes multiple overloads for working with a presentation file or a data stream, capturing text from **slides, master slides, layouts, notes, and comments**. The extracted text is accessed via the `IPresentationText` interface.

Example usage:

```csharp
string filePath = "presentation.pptx";
TextExtractionArrangingMode mode = TextExtractionArrangingMode.Unarranged;

IPresentationText presentationText = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationText(filePath, mode);
ISlideText[] slideTexts = presentationText.SlidesText;

foreach (var slideText in slideTexts)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Slide Text: " + slideText.Text);
    Console.WriteLine("Notes Text: " + slideText.NotesText);
    Console.WriteLine("Comments Text: " + slideText.CommentsText);
}
```

## Modes of Operation for GetPresentationText

The `GetPresentationText` method in `PresentationFactory` lets you fine-tune text extraction using the `TextExtractionArrangingMode` parameter, which controls how text is organized in the output.

### Available Modes:

- **TextExtractionArrangingMode.Unarranged** – Extracts text in a freeform manner, disregarding the original slide layout.  
- **TextExtractionArrangingMode.Arranged** – Preserves text order according to its placement on each slide.

Usage example:

```csharp
TextExtractionArrangingMode mode = TextExtractionArrangingMode.Arranged;
IPresentationText presentationText = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationText("presentation.pptx", mode);
ISlideText[] slideTexts = presentationText.SlidesText;

foreach (var slideText in slideTexts)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Slide Text (preserving order): " + slideText.Text);
}
```
