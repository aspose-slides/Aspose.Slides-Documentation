## **Overview**
Aspose.Slides for .NET does not require Microsoft PowerPoint to be installed because Aspose.Slides is an independent Microsoft PowerPoint document creation, conversion, page layout, and rendering engine.

## **Supported Operating Systems**
Aspose.Slides for .NET supports any 32-bit or 64-bit operating system where .NET or Mono framework is installed including (but not limited to):

### **Windows**
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Windows 2003 Server ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Windows 2022 Server
- Microsoft Windows Vista ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Windows XP ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Windows 7 ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Windows 8, 8.1 ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Windows 10 ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Windows 11 ( x64, x86)
- Microsoft Azure

### **Linux**
- Linux (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, CentOS, Alpine, and others)

Because CentOS 7 ships with GLIBC 2.14 while Aspose.Slides for .NET 6 and .NET 7 (including the cross-platform build) require Linux x86_64 with GLIBC 2.23 or newer, you can use Aspose.Slides for .NET Standard on such a system.

## **Aspose.Slides Main Builds**
Currently, there are two main builds of Aspose.Slides — Aspose.Slides.NET and Aspose.Slides.NET6.CrossPlatform.

### **[Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Slides.NET)**
This is the main version of the product. It uses the standard .NET graphics engine.
- On non-Windows platforms, you may need to install the `libgdiplus` library and its dependencies.
- Prior to version Aspose.Slides 25.3, for non-Windows platforms, it was necessary to use the .NET Standard 2.0 DLL from the Aspose.Slides ZIP package.
- Starting from version Aspose.Slides 25.3, the NuGet package can be used directly even on non-Windows systems.
- When running on non-Windows systems, your application must include the following line at startup:
```cs
AppContext.SetSwitch("System.Drawing.EnableUnixSupport", true);
```
- **Starting from version 25.3, you can use this package on platforms that support .NET, such as Linux aarch64 (ARM64).**

### **[Aspose.Slides for .NET 6 CrossPlatform](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Slides.NET6.CrossPlatform)**
This is the version of Aspose.Slides using a custom cross-platform graphics engine developed by the Aspose.Slides team.  
On non-Windows platforms, the `fontconfig` library may be required.

**Supported Platforms**
- *Windows*: x86, x86_64  
- *Linux*: x86_64  
- *macOS*: x86_64, ARM64

**Planned for Future Support**  
- *Linux*: aarch64 (ARM64) — *ETA: end of 2025*  

**Not Planned**
- *Windows 11 ARM* (ARM64) — *Not currently under consideration*
