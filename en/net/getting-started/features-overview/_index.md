## **FAQ**

**Do I need to install Microsoft PowerPoint on the server/PC for the library to work?**

No. PowerPoint is not required; Aspose.Slides is a standalone engine for creating, editing, converting, and rendering presentations.

**How does multithreading work? Can processing be parallelized?**

It is safe to process different documents in different threads; the same [presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation/) object must not be used by [multiple threads](/slides/net/multithreading/) at the same time.

**Are file passwords and encryption supported?**

Yes. [You can](/slides/net/password-protected-presentation/) open encrypted presentations, set or remove an open and write password, and check the protection status.

**Do I need to care about font packages in Linux containers?**

Yes. It is recommended to install common font packages and/or explicitly [specify font directories](/slides/net/custom-font/) in your application to avoid unexpected substitutions.

**Are there limitations in the evaluation version?**

In [evaluation mode](/slides/net/licensing/), a watermark is added to the output and certain limitations apply; a [30-day temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) is available for full-feature testing.

**Is importing external formats into a presentation (PDF/HTML → PPTX) supported?**

Yes. You can add [PDF pages and HTML content](/slides/net/import-presentation/) to a presentation, turning them into slides.
