In order to format presentation text we need to format that on **Paragraph** and **Portion** level. There are some text properties that can be set on Paragraph level and some are set on Portion level. If there is a paragraph or portion in the text that we need to copy to newly added paragraphs or portions, we need to copy all properties of respective paragraph or portion to newly added paragraph or portion.
