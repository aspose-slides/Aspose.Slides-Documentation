As part of our ongoing efforts to improve product quality and security, we are planning the following changes in **version 25.11**:

- Assemblies targeting **.NET Framework 2.0**, **3.5**, and **4.0** will be removed from the release package.  
- Instead, a new assembly targeting **.NET Framework 4.6.2** will be introduced, offering better support for modern platform features and improved security.
- Support for **.NET Standard 2.1** will be discontinued. Going forward, we will use the more widely compatible **.NET Standard 2.0** assembly instead.

If your projects currently rely on the deprecated platforms, we recommend planning a migration to the supported versions. These changes will allow us to focus on enhancing performance, security, and compatibility with up-to-date platforms.
