## **Overview**

When you password-protect a presentation, it means that you are setting a password which enforces certain restrictions on the presentation. To remove these restrictions, the password must be entered. A password-protected presentation is considered a locked presentation.

Typically, you can set a password to enforce these restrictions on a presentation:

- **Modification**

If you want only certain users to modify your presentation, you can set a modification restriction. This restriction prevents people from modifying, changing, or copying elements in your presentation unless they provide the password. 

However, even without the password, a user will still be able to access and open your document. In this read-only mode, the user can view the content—including hyperlinks, animations, effects, and other elements—inside your presentation, but they cannot copy items or save the presentation.

- **Opening**

If you want only certain users to open your presentation, you can set an opening restriction. This restriction prevents people from even viewing the contents of your presentation unless they provide the password.

Technically, the opening restriction also prevents users from modifying your presentations—if people cannot open a presentation, they cannot modify or make changes to it.

**Note:** When you password protect a presentation to prevent opening, the presentation file becomes encrypted.

## **Protect a Presentation with a Password**

You can encrypt a presentation by setting a password. Then, to modify the locked presentation, a user must provide the password.

To encrypt (or password-protect) a presentation, use the `Encrypt` method from [ProtectionManager](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/protectionmanager) to set a password. Pass the password to the `Encrypt` method, then use the `Save` method to save the now-encrypted presentation.

This sample code shows you how to encrypt a presentation:

```c#
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    presentation.ProtectionManager.Encrypt("123123");
    presentation.Save("encrypted-pres.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

## **Set Write Protection on a Presentation** 

You can add a mark stating "Do not modify" to a presentation. This informs users that you do not want them to make changes to the presentation.

**Note:** The write protection process does not encrypt the presentation. Therefore, users—if they choose to—can modify the presentation, but to save the changes, they will have to save it under a different name.

To set write protection, use the `SetWriteProtection` method. This sample code shows you how to set write protection on a presentation:

```c#
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    presentation.ProtectionManager.SetWriteProtection("123123");
    presentation.Save("write-protected-pres.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

## **Load an Encrypted Presentation**

Aspose.Slides allows you to load an encrypted presentation by passing the correct password. This sample code shows you how to load an encrypted presentation:

```c#
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions { Password = "123123" };
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx", loadOptions))
{
    // Work with the decrypted presentation.
}
```

## **Remove Encryption from a Presentation**

You can remove encryption or password protection from a presentation, allowing users to access or modify it without restrictions.

To remove encryption or password protection, call the [RemoveEncryption](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/protectionmanager/methods/removeencryption) method. This sample code shows you how to remove encryption from a presentation:

```c#
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions { Password = "123123" };
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx", loadOptions))
{
    presentation.ProtectionManager.RemoveEncryption();
    presentation.Save("encryption-removed.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

## **Remove Write Protection from a Presentation**

You can use Aspose.Slides to remove the write protection from a presentation file. This way, users can modify it as they like—and they won't receive any warnings when performing such tasks.

You can remove the write protection by using the [RemoveWriteProtection](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/protectionmanager/methods/removewriteprotection) method. This sample code shows you how to remove the write protection from a presentation:

```c#
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    presentation.ProtectionManager.RemoveWriteProtection();
    presentation.Save("write-protection-removed.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

## **Get Properties of an Encrypted Presentation**

Typically, users struggle to retrieve the document properties of an encrypted or password-protected presentation. However, Aspose.Slides offers a mechanism that allows you to password protect a presentation while still retaining the ability for users to access its properties.

**Note:** By default, when Aspose.Slides encrypts a presentation, the presentation’s document properties are also password protected. If you need to make the document properties accessible even after encryption, Aspose.Slides allows you to do precisely that.

If you want users to retain the ability to access the properties of an encrypted presentation, you can set the [EncryptDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/protectionmanager/properties/encryptdocumentproperties) property to `true`. This sample code shows you how to encrypt a presentation while still providing users access to its document properties:

```c#
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    presentation.ProtectionManager.EncryptDocumentProperties = true;
    presentation.ProtectionManager.Encrypt("123123");
}
```

## **Check whether a Presentation Is Password Protected**

Before you load a presentation, you might want to check that it hasn't been protected with a password. This helps you avoid errors and similar issues that occur when a password-protected presentation is loaded without the correct password.

This C# code shows you how to examine a presentation to see if it is password-protected without actually loading it:

```c#
var presentationInfo = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationInfo("example.pptx");
Console.WriteLine("The presentation is password protected: " + presentationInfo.IsPasswordProtected);
```

## **Check whether a Presentation Is Encrypted**

Aspose.Slides allows you to check whether a presentation is encrypted. To perform this task, you can use the [IsEncrypted](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/protectionmanager/properties/isencrypted) property, which returns `true` if the presentation is encrypted or `false` if it is not.

This sample code shows you how to check whether a presentation is encrypted:

```c#
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    bool isEncrypted = presentation.ProtectionManager.IsEncrypted;
}
```

## **Check whether a Presentation Is Write Protected**

Aspose.Slides allows you to check whether a presentation is write-protected. To perform this task, you can use the [IsWriteProtected](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/protectionmanager/properties/iswriteprotected) property, which returns `true` if the presentation is write-protected or `false` if it is not.

This sample code shows you how to check whether a presentation is write-protected:

```c#
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    bool isEncrypted = presentation.ProtectionManager.IsWriteProtected;
}
```

## **Verify Presentation Password Usage**

You may want to check and confirm that a specific password has been used to protect a presentation document. Aspose.Slides provides the means for you to validate a password.

This sample code shows you how to validate a password:

```c#
using (IPresentation presentation = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    // Check if the password matches.
    bool isWriteProtected = presentation.ProtectionManager.CheckWriteProtection("my_password");
}
```

It returns `true` if the presentation has been encrypted with the specified password; otherwise, it returns `false`.

## **FAQs**

**What encryption methods are supported by Aspose.Slides?**

Aspose.Slides supports modern encryption methods, including AES-based algorithms, ensuring a high level of data security for your presentations.

**What happens if an incorrect password is entered when attempting to open a presentation?**

An exception is thrown if an incorrect password is used, alerting you that access to the presentation is denied. This helps prevent unauthorized access and protects the presentation content.

**Are there any performance implications when working with password-protected presentations?**

The encryption and decryption process may introduce a slight overhead during opening and saving operations. In most cases, this performance impact is minimal and does not significantly affect the overall processing time of your presentation tasks.
