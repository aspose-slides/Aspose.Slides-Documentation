## **Overview**

[Open Presentations in C#](/slides/net/open-presentation/) described how to use the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class to open a presentation. This article explains how to create and save presentations. The [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class contains a presentation’s contents. Whether you’re creating a presentation from scratch or modifying an existing one, you’ll want to save it when you’re finished. With Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can save to a **file** or **stream**. This article explains the different ways to save a presentation.

## **Save Presentations to Files**

Save a presentation to a file by calling the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class’s `Save` method. Pass the file name and save format to the method. The following example show how to save a presentation with Aspose.Slides.

```cs
// Instantiate the Presentation class that represents a presentation file.
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    // Do some work here...

    // Save the presentation to a file.
    presentation.Save("Output.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

## **Save Presentations to Streams**

You can save a presentation to a stream by passing an output stream to the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation/) class’s `Save` method. A presentation can be written to many stream types. In the example below, we create a new presentation and save it to a file stream.

```cs
// Instantiate the Presentation class that represents a presentation file.
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("Output.pptx", FileMode.Create))
    {
        // Save the presentation to the stream.
        presentation.Save(fileStream, SaveFormat.Pptx);
    }
}
```

## **Save Presentations with a Predefined View Type**

Aspose.Slides lets you set the initial view that PowerPoint uses when the generated presentation opens through the [ViewProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/viewproperties/) class. Set the [LastView](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/viewproperties/lastview/) property to a value from the [ViewType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/viewtype/) enumeration.

```cs
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    presentation.ViewProperties.LastView = ViewType.SlideMasterView;
    presentation.Save("SlideMasterView.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

## **Save Presentations in the Strict Office Open XML Format**

Aspose.Slides lets you save a presentation in the Strict Office Open XML format. Use the [PptxOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.export/pptxoptions/) class and set its conformance property when saving. If you set `Conformance.Iso29500_2008_Strict`, the output file is saved in the Strict Office Open XML format.

The example below creates a presentation and saves it in the Strict Office Open XML format.

```cs
PptxOptions options = new PptxOptions()
{
    Conformance = Conformance.Iso29500_2008_Strict
};

// Instantiate the Presentation class that represents a presentation file.
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    // Save the presentation in the Strict Office Open XML format.
    presentation.Save("StrictOfficeOpenXml.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx, options);
}
```

## **Save Presentations in Office Open XML Format in Zip64 Mode**

An Office Open XML file is a ZIP archive that imposes 4 GB (2^32 bytes) limits on the uncompressed size of any file, the compressed size of any file, and the total size of the archive, and it also limits the archive to 65,535 (2^16-1) files. ZIP64 format extensions raise these limits to 2^64.

The [IPptxOptions.Zip64Mode](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.export/ipptxoptions/zip64mode/) property lets you choose when to use ZIP64 format extensions when saving an Office Open XML file.

This property provides the following modes:

- `IfNecessary` uses ZIP64 format extensions only if the presentation exceeds the limitations above. This is the default mode.
- `Never` never uses ZIP64 format extensions.
- `Always` always uses ZIP64 format extensions.

The following code demonstrates how to save a presentation as PPTX with ZIP64 format extensions enabled:

```cs
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("Sample.pptx"))
{
    presentation.Save("OutputZip64.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx, new PptxOptions()
    {
        Zip64Mode = Zip64Mode.Always
    });
}
```

{{% alert title="NOTE" color="warning" %}}

When you save with `Zip64Mode.Never`, a [PptxException](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/pptxexception/) is thrown if the presentation cannot be saved in ZIP32 format.

{{% /alert %}}

## **Save Presentations without Refreshing the Thumbnail**

The [PptxOptions.RefreshThumbnail](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.export/ipptxoptions/refreshthumbnail/) property controls thumbnail generation when saving a presentation to PPTX:

- If set to `true`, the thumbnail is refreshed during save. This is the default.
- If set to `false`, the current thumbnail is preserved. If the presentation has no thumbnail, none is generated.

In the code below, the presentation is saved to PPTX without refreshing its thumbnail.

```cs
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("Sample.pptx"))
{
    presentation.Save("Output.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx, new PptxOptions()
    {
        RefreshThumbnail = false
    });
}
```

{{% alert title="Info" color="info" %}}

This option helps reduce the time required to save a presentation in PPTX format.

{{% /alert %}}

## **Save Progress Updates in Percentage**

The [IProgressCallback](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/iprogresscallback/) interface is used via the `ProgressCallback` property exposed by the [ISaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.export/isaveoptions/) interface and the abstract [SaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.export/saveoptions/) class. Assign an [IProgressCallback](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/iprogresscallback/) implementation to `ProgressCallback` to receive save-progress updates as a percentage.

The following code snippets show how to use `IProgressCallback`.

```cs
ISaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfOptions();
saveOptions.ProgressCallback = new ExportProgressHandler();

using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("Sample.pptx"))
{
    presentation.Save("Output.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, saveOptions);
}
```

```cs
class ExportProgressHandler : IProgressCallback
{
    public void Reporting(double progressValue)
    {
        // Use the progress percentage value here.
        int progress = Convert.ToInt32(progressValue);

        Console.WriteLine(progress + "% of the file has been converted.");
    }
}
```

Aspose has developed a [free PowerPoint Splitter app](https://products.aspose.app/slides/splitter) using its own API. The app lets you split a presentation into multiple files by saving selected slides as new PPTX or PPT files.
