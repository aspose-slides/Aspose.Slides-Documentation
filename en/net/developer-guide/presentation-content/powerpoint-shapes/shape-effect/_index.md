## **Introduction**

While effects in PowerPoint can be used to make a shape stand out, they differ from [fills](/slides/net/shape-formatting/#gradient-fill) or outlines. Using PowerPoint effects, you can create convincing reflections on a shape, spread a shape's glow, etc.

PowerPoint provides six effects that can be applied to shapes. You can apply one or more effects to a shape.

Some combinations of effects look better than others. For this reason, PowerPoint has options under **Preset**. The Preset options are essentially a known good-looking combination of two or more effects. This way, by selecting a preset, you won't have to waste time testing or combining different effects to find a nice combination.

Aspose.Slides provides properties and methods under the [EffectFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/) class that allow you to apply the same effects to shapes in PowerPoint presentations.

## **Apply a Shadow Effect**

Aspose.Slides for .NET supports outer and inner shadows for shapes. You can customize their color, direction, distance, and blur radius to match your presentation's design.

### **Apply an Outer Shadow**

Use an outer shadow to make a card or panel stand out against the slide background. The shadow extends beyond the shape's edges, creating the impression that the shape is raised above the slide. Adjust its color, direction, distance, and blur radius to match the lighting and styling of your template.

This C# code shows how to apply the [outer shadow effect](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/outershadoweffect/) to a rectangle:

```c#
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

using var presentation = new Presentation();
var slide = presentation.Slides[0];

var shape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.RoundCornerRectangle, 20, 20, 200, 100);
shape.EffectFormat.EnableOuterShadowEffect();
shape.EffectFormat.OuterShadowEffect.ShadowColor.Color = Color.DarkGray;
shape.EffectFormat.OuterShadowEffect.Distance = 10;
shape.EffectFormat.OuterShadowEffect.Direction = 45;

presentation.Save("shadow_effect.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### **Apply an Inner Shadow**

When reproducing a template's visual styling, use an inner shadow to give a card or panel a recessed appearance. An outer shadow extends outside the shape and makes it appear raised, while an inner shadow shades the inside of its edges.

Call [EnableInnerShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/enableinnershadoweffect/), then configure [InnerShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/innershadoweffect/). Larger values produce softer edges.

This C# example creates a light blue card with a dark gray inner shadow and saves it as a PPTX file:

```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

using var presentation = new Presentation();
var slide = presentation.Slides[0];

var shape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 20, 20, 200, 100);
shape.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
shape.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.LightBlue;
shape.LineFormat.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.NoFill;

shape.EffectFormat.EnableInnerShadowEffect();
var shadow = shape.EffectFormat.InnerShadowEffect;
shadow.ShadowColor.Color = Color.DimGray;
shadow.Direction = 225;
shadow.Distance = 7;
shadow.BlurRadius = 6;

presentation.Save("inner_shadow_effect.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

To remove the inner shadow, call [DisableInnerShadowEffect](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/disableinnershadoweffect/) on the shape's effect format.

## **Apply a Reflection Effect**

To apply a reflection effect in Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can add a mirror-like reflection to shapes, adjusting parameters such as distance, transparency, and size. This effect enhances the aesthetic of your presentations by giving shapes a more polished and sophisticated look. It’s easy to implement with simple code, enabling quick application across multiple elements for a consistent design.

This C# code shows how to apply the [reflection effect](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/reflectioneffect/) to a shape:

```c#
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

using var presentation = new Presentation();
var slide = presentation.Slides[0];

var shape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.RoundCornerRectangle, 20, 20, 200, 100);
shape.EffectFormat.EnableReflectionEffect();
shape.EffectFormat.ReflectionEffect.RectangleAlign = RectangleAlignment.Bottom;
shape.EffectFormat.ReflectionEffect.Direction = 90;
shape.EffectFormat.ReflectionEffect.Distance = 40;
shape.EffectFormat.ReflectionEffect.BlurRadius = 2;

presentation.Save("reflection_effect.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## **Apply a Glow Effect**

To apply a glow effect to a shape in Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can add a soft, luminous aura around shapes, adjusting properties like color and size. This effect helps make shapes stand out and adds an attractive, eye-catching visual element to your presentation. It's easy to implement with minimal code, enhancing the overall look of your slides.

This C# code shows how to apply the [glow effect](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/gloweffect/) to a shape:

```c#
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

using var presentation = new Presentation();
var slide = presentation.Slides[0];

var shape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.RoundCornerRectangle, 20, 20, 200, 100);
shape.EffectFormat.EnableGlowEffect();
shape.EffectFormat.GlowEffect.Color.Color = Color.Magenta;
shape.EffectFormat.GlowEffect.Radius = 15;

presentation.Save("glow_effect.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## **Apply a Soft Edges Effect**

To apply a soft edges effect in Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can create a smooth, blurred transition around the edges of a shape. This effect adds a more subtle and refined look, perfect for designs that need a gentle, softer appearance. You can easily adjust parameters like radius to achieve the desired effect across various shapes in your presentation.

This C# code shows how to apply the [soft edges](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/effectformat/softedgeeffect/) to a shape:

```c#
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

using var presentation = new Presentation();
var slide = presentation.Slides[0];

var shape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.RoundCornerRectangle, 20, 20, 200, 150);
shape.EffectFormat.EnableSoftEdgeEffect();
shape.EffectFormat.SoftEdgeEffect.Radius = 8;

presentation.Save("soft_edges_effect.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## **FAQ**

**Can I apply multiple effects to the same shape?**

Yes, you can combine different effects, such as shadow, reflection, and glow, on a single shape to create a more dynamic appearance.

**What shapes can I apply effects to?**

You can apply effects to various shapes, including autoshapes, charts, tables, pictures, SmartArt objects, OLE objects, and more.

**Can I apply effects to grouped shapes?**

Yes, you can apply effects to grouped shapes. The effect will apply to the entire group.
