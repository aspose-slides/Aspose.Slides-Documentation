## **Introduction**

While parallel work with presentations is possible (besides parsing/loading/cloning) and everything goes well (most times), there is a small chance you might get incorrect results when you use the library in multiple threads.

We strongly recommend that you do **not** use a single [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/Presentation) instance in a multi-threading environment because it might result in unpredictable errors or failures that are not easily detected.

It is **not** safe to load, save, and/or clone an instance of a [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/Presentation) class in multiple threads. Such operations are **not** supported.  If you need to perform such tasks, you have to parallel the operations using several single-threaded processesâ€”and each of these processes should use its own presentation instance.

We do not guarantee multithreading in PHP when using extensions. If you use them, do so at your own risk.
