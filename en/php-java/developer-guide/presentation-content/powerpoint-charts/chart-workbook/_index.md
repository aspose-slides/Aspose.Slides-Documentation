## **Overview**

This article explains how to work with chart workbooks in Aspose.Slides. It shows how to read and write chart data through workbook streams, use workbook cells as chart data labels, access worksheet collections, and specify the data source type for chart values.

It also covers working with external workbooks as chart data sources. The examples demonstrate how to create and assign an external workbook, retrieve the path of an external workbook linked to a chart, and edit chart data when the workbook is available.

For workbook cells that represent missing data, see [Control the Display of Empty Cells](/slides/php-java/chart-series/) for the difference between an empty cell and zero, and a line-chart comparison of the available display modes.

## **Include Data from Hidden Rows and Columns**

Use [Chart::setPlotVisibleCellsOnly](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chart/setplotvisiblecellsonly/) to control whether a chart plots data from hidden worksheet rows and columns. Set it to `true` to plot only visible cells, or `false` to include both visible and hidden cells. This setting controls chart plotting; it does not hide or unhide worksheet rows or columns.

The [sample presentation](hidden-source-data.pptx) contains a column chart as the first shape on its first slide. The embedded worksheet, `Sheet1`, contains the following source range, `A1:C4`. Row 3 and column C are hidden, but their cells still contain values.

| Worksheet row | A: Month | B: Retail | C: Wholesale (hidden column) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | January | 10 | 30 |
| 3 (hidden row) | February | 40 | 60 |
| 4 | March | 20 | 50 |

Access source cells through [ChartData::getChartDataWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/getchartdataworkbook/) and read [ChartDataCell::isHidden](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdatacell/ishidden/) to inspect their hidden status. This method reports the hidden status without changing it. In this file, B2 is visible, B3 belongs to the hidden row, and C2 belongs to the hidden column; the example prints `false`, `true`, and `true`, respectively.

For this example, refresh the chart data after changing the plotting setting: retain the embedded workbook with [readWorkbookStream](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/readworkbookstream/) and reload it with [writeWorkbookStream](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/writeworkbookstream/). When including all cells, also use [setRange](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/setrange/) to restore the complete range, including the hidden February category. Simply changing the flag is insufficient to refresh this sample's cached chart data and category labels.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;

$presentation = new Presentation("hidden-source-data.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $shapeCount = java_values($slide->getShapes()->size());
    if ($shapeCount > 0 && java_instanceof($slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0), new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.IChart"))) {
        $chart = $slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0);
        $workbook = $chart->getChartData()->getChartDataWorkbook();
        echo "B2 hidden: " . (java_values($workbook->getCell(0, "B2")->isHidden()) ? "true" : "false"), PHP_EOL;
        echo "B3 hidden: " . (java_values($workbook->getCell(0, "B3")->isHidden()) ? "true" : "false"), PHP_EOL;
        echo "C2 hidden: " . (java_values($workbook->getCell(0, "C2")->isHidden()) ? "true" : "false"), PHP_EOL;

        $workbookData = $chart->getChartData()->readWorkbookStream();
        foreach ([true, false] as $visibleOnly) {
            $chart->setPlotVisibleCellsOnly($visibleOnly);

            // Refresh the chart data from the embedded workbook.
            $chart->getChartData()->writeWorkbookStream($workbookData);
            if (!$visibleOnly) {
                // Restore the complete source range, including hidden categories.
                $chart->getChartData()->setRange('Sheet1!$A$1:$C$4');
            }

            $presentation->save("hidden_cells_" . ($visibleOnly ? "true" : "false") . ".pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
        }
    } else {
        echo "The first shape is not a chart.", PHP_EOL;
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

The example saves two versions of the presentation: one with only the visible Retail values (10 and 20), and another with all six values. The images below illustrate the two plotting modes. Row 3 and column C remain hidden in both embedded workbooks.

| Only visible cells (`true`) | All cells (`false`) |
| --- | --- |
| ![Only visible cells: Retail values 10 and 20 for January and March.](hidden_cells_True.png) | ![All cells: Retail and Wholesale values for January, February, and March.](hidden_cells_False.png) |

A hidden cell containing a value is different from an empty cell. [Chart::setDisplayBlanksAs](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chart/setdisplayblanksas/) controls how missing values are displayed; it does not include or exclude hidden source data. See [Control the Display of Empty Cells](/slides/php-java/chart-series/#control-the-display-of-empty-cells) for an example.

## **Retrieve a Chart's Data Range**

Before updating workbook data in an existing presentation, inspect the source ranges to identify which worksheet cells each chart uses. The [ChartData::getRange](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/getrange/) method returns the current data range as a worksheet-qualified formula, such as `Sheet1!$A$1:$D$5`. Here, `Sheet1` is the worksheet name, `!` separates it from the cell range, and `$A$1:$D$5` identifies cells A1 through D5, inclusive. The dollar signs indicate absolute row and column references.

The method reads the current range without changing the chart or its workbook. If the chart does not use a workbook as its data source, it throws an exception. For more information, see the [ChartData API Reference](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/).

This example opens a presentation and checks the shapes directly on each slide for charts. It prints each chart's name and source range. If a chart does not use a workbook, it prints a message and continues to the next chart.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;

$presentation = new Presentation("presentation.pptx");
try {
    $slideCount = java_values($presentation->getSlides()->size());
    for ($slideIndex = 0; $slideIndex < $slideCount; $slideIndex++) {
        $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item($slideIndex);
        $shapeCount = java_values($slide->getShapes()->size());
        for ($shapeIndex = 0; $shapeIndex < $shapeCount; $shapeIndex++) {
            $shape = $slide->getShapes()->get_Item($shapeIndex);
            if (java_instanceof($shape, new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.IChart"))) {
                $chart = $shape;
                try {
                    $range = $chart->getChartData()->getRange();
                    echo $chart->getName() . ": " . $range, PHP_EOL;
                } catch (JavaException $exception) {
                    if (java_instanceof($exception, new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.exceptions.InvalidOperationException"))) {
                        echo $chart->getName() . ": The chart does not use a workbook as its data source.", PHP_EOL;
                    } else {
                        echo $chart->getName() . ": " . $exception->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

## **Read and Write Chart Data from a Workbook**

Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java provides the [readWorkbookStream](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/readworkbookstream/) and [writeWorkbookStream](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/writeworkbookstream/) methods that allow you to read and write chart data workbooks (containing chart data edited with Aspose.Cells). **Note** that the chart data has to be organized in the same manner or must have a structure similar to the source.

This example uses a presentation with a chart as the first shape on its first slide. It reads the embedded workbook into a byte array, clears the existing series and categories, and writes the same workbook back. The changes remain in memory; the example does not save the presentation.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;

$presentation = new Presentation("chart.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $shapeCount = java_values($slide->getShapes()->size());
    if ($shapeCount > 0 && java_instanceof($slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0), new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.IChart"))) {
        $chart = $slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0);
        $chartData = $chart->getChartData();
        $workbookData = $chartData->readWorkbookStream();

        $chartData->getSeries()->clear();
        $chartData->getCategories()->clear();

        $chartData->writeWorkbookStream($workbookData);
    } else {
        echo "The first shape is not a chart.", PHP_EOL;
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

### **Validate Chart Layout After Workbook Modification**

When you replace an embedded workbook with a modified one, the chart retains its original series and category collections. This mismatch can cause [Chart::validateChartLayout](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chart/validatechartlayout/) to fail with an index-out-of-range error. Clear the existing series and categories before writing the updated workbook back to the chart. This example uses a chart that is the first shape on the first slide. The comment marks where workbook editing would occur; the runnable example writes the original workbook back and validates the layout in memory.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;

$presentation = new Presentation("chart.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $shapeCount = java_values($slide->getShapes()->size());
    if ($shapeCount > 0 && java_instanceof($slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0), new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.IChart"))) {
        $chart = $slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0);
        $chartData = $chart->getChartData();
        $workbookData = $chartData->readWorkbookStream();

        // Modify the workbook bytes here, for example, using Aspose.Cells.

        $chartData->getSeries()->clear();
        $chartData->getCategories()->clear();

        $chartData->writeWorkbookStream($workbookData);
        $chart->validateChartLayout();
    } else {
        echo "The first shape is not a chart.", PHP_EOL;
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

Clearing the collections removes stale data references before the workbook is written back. Rebuild any required series and category mappings for the updated workbook before using the chart.

## **Set a Workbook Cell as a Chart Data Label**

You can use text from workbook cells as chart data labels.

This example adds a bubble chart with default data to the first slide of an existing presentation. It uses cells A10:A12 on worksheet 0 for the first three labels in the first series, enables labels from cells, and saves the updated presentation.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\ChartType;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;

$presentation = new Presentation("chart2.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $chart = $slide->getShapes()->addChart(ChartType::Bubble, 50, 50, 600, 400, true);
    $series = $chart->getChartData()->getSeries()->get_Item(0);
    $workbook = $chart->getChartData()->getChartDataWorkbook();

    $series->getLabels()->getDefaultDataLabelFormat()->setShowLabelValueFromCell(true);
    $series->getLabels()->get_Item(0)->setValueFromCell($workbook->getCell(0, "A10", "Label 0 cell value"));
    $series->getLabels()->get_Item(1)->setValueFromCell($workbook->getCell(0, "A11", "Label 1 cell value"));
    $series->getLabels()->get_Item(2)->setValueFromCell($workbook->getCell(0, "A12", "Label 2 cell value"));

    $presentation->save("resultchart.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

## **Manage Worksheets**

The [ChartDataWorkbook::getWorksheets](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdataworkbook/getworksheets/) method provides access to the worksheets in a chart workbook. This example creates a pie chart with default data and prints each worksheet name to the console.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\ChartType;

$presentation = new Presentation();
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $chart = $slide->getShapes()->addChart(ChartType::Pie, 50, 50, 400, 500);
    $workbook = $chart->getChartData()->getChartDataWorkbook();

    for ($i = 0; $i < java_values($workbook->getWorksheets()->size()); $i++) {
        echo $workbook->getWorksheets()->get_Item($i)->getName(), PHP_EOL;
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

## **Specify the Data Source Type**

This example creates a 3D column chart with default data and sets two series names using different data sources. The first name uses a string literal; the second uses cell C1 on worksheet 0. The [DataSourceType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/datasourcetype/) enumeration selects the source for each name. The example saves the presentation with the updated series names.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\ChartType;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;
use aspose\slides\DataSourceType;

$presentation = new Presentation();
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $chart = $slide->getShapes()->addChart(ChartType::Column3D, 50, 50, 600, 400, true);
    $literalName = $chart->getChartData()->getSeries()->get_Item(0)->getName();

    $literalName->setDataSourceType(DataSourceType::StringLiterals);
    $literalName->setData("LiteralString");

    $cellName = $chart->getChartData()->getSeries()->get_Item(1)->getName();
    $nameCell = $chart->getChartData()->getChartDataWorkbook()->getCell(0, "C1", "NewCell");
    $cellName->setDataSourceType(DataSourceType::Worksheet);
    $cellName->setData($nameCell);

    $presentation->save("pres.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

## **Detect Unsupported Embedded Workbook Formats**

Aspose.Slides does not support the Excel binary workbook (.xlsb) format that can be embedded in some charts. You can use the `getEmbeddedWorkbookType` method on [ChartData](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/) together with the [WorkbookType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/workbooktype/) enumeration to detect unsupported formats and skip those charts. This example inspects the shapes on the first slide of an existing presentation, skips non-chart shapes, and prints a diagnostic message for each chart with an embedded .xlsb workbook.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\ChartDataSourceType;
use aspose\slides\WorkbookType;

$presentation = new Presentation("sample.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $shapeCount = java_values($slide->getShapes()->size());
    for ($shapeIndex = 0; $shapeIndex < $shapeCount; $shapeIndex++) {
        $shape = $slide->getShapes()->get_Item($shapeIndex);
        if (!java_instanceof($shape, new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.IChart"))) {
            continue;
        }

        $chart = $shape;
        $chartData = $chart->getChartData();
        $isInternalWorkbook = java_values($chartData->getDataSourceType()) == ChartDataSourceType::InternalWorkbook;
        $isBinaryMacro = java_values($chartData->getEmbeddedWorkbookType()) == WorkbookType::WorkbookBinaryMacro;

        if ($isInternalWorkbook && $isBinaryMacro) {
            echo "Skipping a chart with an unsupported .xlsb workbook.", PHP_EOL;
            continue;
        }

        // Read or modify supported chart workbook data here.
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

## **External Workbook**

Aspose.Slides supports using external workbooks as a data source for charts.

### **Create an External Workbook**

Use [readWorkbookStream](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/readworkbookstream/) and [setExternalWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/setexternalworkbook/) to export an embedded chart workbook to a file and link the chart to that external workbook.

This example creates a pie chart with default data and exports its workbook. It completes the file write before assigning the external workbook as the chart data source, then saves the linked presentation.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\ChartType;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;

$presentation = new Presentation();
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $chart = $slide->getShapes()->addChart(ChartType::Pie, 50, 50, 400, 600);
    $workbookPath = new Java("java.io.File", "externalWorkbook1.xlsx");
    $workbookData = $chart->getChartData()->readWorkbookStream();
    try {
        $fileStream = new Java("java.io.FileOutputStream", $workbookPath);
        try {
            $fileStream->write($workbookData);
        } finally {
            $fileStream->close();
        }
        $chart->getChartData()->setExternalWorkbook($workbookPath->getAbsolutePath());
        
        $presentation->save("externalWorkbook.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
    } catch (JavaException $exception) {
        echo "Could not write the external workbook: " . $exception->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```


### **Set an External Workbook**

Using the [setExternalWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/setexternalworkbook/) method, you can assign an external workbook to a chart as its data source. This method can also be used to update a path to the external workbook (if the latter has been moved).

While you cannot edit the data in workbooks stored in remote locations or resources, you can still use such workbooks as an external data source. If the relative path for an external workbook is provided, it gets converted to a full path automatically.

This example uses an external workbook whose worksheet named `Sheet1` contains a series name in B1, category names in A2:A4, and numeric values in B2:B4. The example creates a pie chart, links the workbook, and uses [setRange](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/setrange/) to map A1:B4 to one series and three categories. It saves the presentation with the linked chart.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\ChartType;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;

$presentation = new Presentation();
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $chart = $slide->getShapes()->addChart(ChartType::Pie, 50, 50, 400, 600, true);
    $chartData = $chart->getChartData();
    $workbookFile = new Java("java.io.File", "externalWorkbook.xlsx");
    $workbookPath = $workbookFile->getAbsolutePath();

    $chartData->setExternalWorkbook($workbookPath);
    $chartData->setRange('Sheet1!$A$1:$B$4');

    $presentation->save("Presentation_with_externalWorkbook.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

The `updateChartData` parameter of [setExternalWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/setexternalworkbook/) controls whether the workbook is loaded.

* When `updateChartData` is `false`, only the workbook path is updated. The chart data is not loaded or updated from the target workbook, so the workbook can be unavailable.
* When `updateChartData` is `true`, the chart data is updated from the target workbook.

The following example assigns a placeholder URL with `updateChartData` set to `false`. It retains the pie chart's default data and saves the presentation without loading the unavailable workbook.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\ChartType;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;

$presentation = new Presentation();
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $chart = $slide->getShapes()->addChart(ChartType::Pie, 50, 50, 400, 600, true);
    $chart->getChartData()->setExternalWorkbook("https://example.com/unavailable-workbook.xlsx", false);

    $presentation->save("SetExternalWorkbookWithUpdateChartData.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

### **Get the External Data Source Workbook Path of a Chart**

To identify the workbook linked to a chart, check whether the chart uses an external data source and retrieve its workbook path.

This example inspects the first shape on the first slide of a presentation with a linked external workbook. If it is a chart linked to an external workbook, the example prints [getExternalWorkbookPath](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/getexternalworkbookpath/) to the console. It then saves a copy of the presentation.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;
use aspose\slides\ChartDataSourceType;

$presentation = new Presentation("externalWorkbook.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $shapeCount = java_values($slide->getShapes()->size());
    if ($shapeCount > 0 && java_instanceof($slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0), new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.IChart"))) {
        $chart = $slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0);
        $chartData = $chart->getChartData();
        if (java_values($chartData->getDataSourceType()) == ChartDataSourceType::ExternalWorkbook) {
            echo $chartData->getExternalWorkbookPath(), PHP_EOL;
        } else {
            echo "The chart does not use an external workbook.", PHP_EOL;
        }
    } else {
        echo "The first shape is not a chart.", PHP_EOL;
    }

    $presentation->save("Result.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

### **Edit Chart Data**

You can edit the data in external workbooks the same way you make changes to the contents of internal workbooks. When an external workbook cannot be loaded, an exception is thrown.

This example uses a chart that is the first shape on the first slide and is linked to an accessible external workbook. It sets the cell-backed value of the first data point in the first series to 100 and saves the updated presentation. Editing cell values can update the linked external XLSX file, so use a copy if you need to preserve the original workbook.

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\SaveFormat;

$presentation = new Presentation("presentation.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);

    $shapeCount = java_values($slide->getShapes()->size());
    if ($shapeCount > 0 && java_instanceof($slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0), new JavaClass("com.aspose.slides.IChart"))) {
        $chart = $slide->getShapes()->get_Item(0);
        $series = $chart->getChartData()->getSeries();
        if (java_values($series->size()) > 0 && java_values($series->get_Item(0)->getDataPoints()->size()) > 0) {
            $valueCell = $series->get_Item(0)->getDataPoints()->get_Item(0)->getValue()->getAsCell();
            if (!java_is_null($valueCell)) {
                $valueCell->setValue(100);
                $presentation->save("presentation_out.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
            } else {
                echo "The first data point is not linked to a workbook cell.", PHP_EOL;
            }
        } else {
            echo "The chart has no data points to edit.", PHP_EOL;
        }
    } else {
        echo "The first shape is not a chart.", PHP_EOL;
    }
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

### **Recover a Workbook from the Chart Cache**

If a chart uses an external workbook that is missing or unavailable, Aspose.Slides can reconstruct the chart workbook from the data cached in the presentation. Create [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/loadoptions/), call [LoadOptions::setSpreadsheetOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/loadoptions/setspreadsheetoptions/), and set [SpreadsheetOptions::setRecoverWorkbookFromChartCache](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/spreadsheetoptions/setrecoverworkbookfromchartcache/) to `true` before opening the presentation.

The following PHP example recovers workbook data for a chart that is the first shape on the first slide and references an unavailable external workbook. It accesses the recovered data through [Chart::getChartData](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chart/getchartdata/) and [ChartData::getChartDataWorkbook](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/getchartdataworkbook/):

```php
use aspose\slides\Presentation;
use aspose\slides\SpreadsheetOptions;

If the external workbook is unavailable and recovery is disabled, Aspose.Slides throws an exception. Enable recovery only when using the cached chart data is an acceptable fallback, because the cache may not contain changes made to the external workbook after the presentation was last updated.

## **FAQ**

**Can I determine whether a specific chart is linked to an external or an embedded workbook?**

Yes. A chart has a [data source type](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/getdatasourcetype/) and a [path to an external workbook](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/getexternalworkbookpath/); if the source is an external workbook, you can read the full path to make sure an external file is being used.

**Are relative paths to external workbooks supported, and how are they stored?**

Yes. If you specify a relative path, it is automatically converted to an absolute path. The presentation stores the absolute path in the PPTX file, so moving the workbook may require updating the link.

**Can I use workbooks located on network resources/shares?**

Yes, such workbooks can be used as an external data source. However, editing remote workbooks directly from Aspose.Slides is not supportedвЂ”they can only be used as a source.

**Does Aspose.Slides overwrite the external XLSX when saving the presentation?**

The presentation stores a [link to the external file](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/php-java/aspose.slides/chartdata/getexternalworkbookpath/). Editing cell-backed chart data can also update the linked local XLSX file. Use a copy of the workbook if the original must remain unchanged.

**What should I do if the external file is password-protected?**

Aspose.Slides does not accept a password when linking. A common approach is to remove protection in advance or prepare a decrypted copy (for example, using [Aspose.Cells](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/)) and link to that copy.

**Can multiple charts reference the same external workbook?**

Yes. Each chart stores its own link. If they all point to the same file, updating that file will be reflected in each chart the next time the data is loaded.
