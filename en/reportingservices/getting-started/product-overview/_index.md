### **Product Overview**
Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services does not have built-in abilities to export reports as Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, but after installing Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services on your server, you get access to additional export formats:

- PPT - PowerPoint Presentation via Aspose.Slides
- PPS - PowerPoint SlideShow via Aspose.Slides
- PPTX - PowerPoint 2007 Presentation via Aspose.Slides
- PPSX - PowerPoint 2007 SlideShow via Aspose.Slides

Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services creates presentations on the server without using Microsoft PowerPoint. Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services internally uses Aspose.Slides for .NET – the world-class component for server-side presentations processing.

**Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services makes it possible to export any report in PPT, PPS, PPTX or PPSX format.**
