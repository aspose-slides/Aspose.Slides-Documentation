Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services fully supports all of the RDL specifications. This means two great things: 

- No need to redesign existing reports. You can export any existing RDL report as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation and it will appear exactly according to the RDL design.
- No need to use a specific report designer. You can use any RDL report designer and the report will be exported exactly the way you designed it.
