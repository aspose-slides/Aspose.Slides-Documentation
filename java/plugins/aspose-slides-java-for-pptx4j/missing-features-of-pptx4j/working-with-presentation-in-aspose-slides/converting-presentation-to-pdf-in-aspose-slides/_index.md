## **Aspose.Slides - Converting Presentation to PDF**
Aspose.Slides for Java offers the [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class that represents a presentation file. The Presentation class exposes the Save method that can be called to convert the whole presentation into a PDF document. The [PdfOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/PdfOptions) class provides options for creating the PDF such as JpegQuality, TextCompression, Compliance and others. These options can be used to get the desired standard of PDF.

**Java**

``` java

 //Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file

Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "presentation.ppt");

//Saving the presentation to PDF document

pres.save(dataDir + "AsposeConvert.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);

```
