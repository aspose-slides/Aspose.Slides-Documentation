## **Introduction**
### **pptx4j**
pptx4j is an open source (ASLv2) Java library for creating and manipulating Microsoft Open XML Powerpoint pptx files similar to docx4j for manipulating Microsoft Open XML Word docx files.
It is similar to Microsoft’s OpenXML SDK, but for Java. pptx4j uses JAXB to create the in-memory object representation.
You’ll need to take the time to understand JAXB, and the Open XML file structure.

### **Aspose.Slides for Java**
[Aspose.Slides for Java](http://www.aspose.com/java/powerpoint-component.aspx) is a unique PowerPoint management component that enables Java applications to read, write and manipulate PowerPoint documents (PPT, PPTX, POS, PPS, POTX, PPSX) PDF, HTML and image file formats without using Microsoft PowerPoint.

Aspose.Slides for Java is the first and only Java component that provides functionality to manage PowerPoint documents within your own applications.

As with all Aspose Java components, Aspose.Slides for Java is written in pure Java, incredibly priced and lightning fast.
