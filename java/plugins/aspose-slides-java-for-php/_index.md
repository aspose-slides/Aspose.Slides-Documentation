## **Introduction to Aspose.Slides Java for PHP**
### **PHP / Java Bridge**
The PHP/Java Bridge is an implementation of a streaming, XML-based [network protocol](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/PROTOCOL.TXT), which can be used to connect a native script engine, for example PHP, Scheme or Python, with a Java virtual machine. It is up to 50 times faster than local RPC via SOAP, requires less resources on the web-server side. It is [faster](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/FAQ.html#performance) and more reliable than direct communication via the Java Native Interface, and it requires no additional components to invoke Java procedures from PHP or PHP procedures from Java.

### **Aspose.Slides for Java**
Aspose.Slides for Java is a unique PowerPoint management component that enables Java based applications to read, write and manipulate PowerPoint documents without using Microsoft PowerPoint.One can generate, modify, copy, convert, render and print presentations without installing Microsoft PowerPoint.

Aspose.Slides for Java supports presentation file formats including PPT, PPS, POT, PresentationML (OOXML, PPTX) and Open Document Presentations (ODP).
### **Aspose.Slides Java for PHP**

### **Download Required Libraries**
Download required libraries mentioned below. These are the required for executing Aspose.Slides Java for PHP examples.

- **Aspose:** [Aspose.Slides for Java Component](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.slides-for-java/default.aspx)
- [PHP/Java Bridge](http://citylan.dl.sourceforge.net/project/php-java-bridge/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip)
### **Download Examples from Social Coding Sites**
Following releases of running examples are available to download on below mentioned social coding sites:

-----
#### **GitHub**
- **Aspose.Slides Java for PHP Examples** 
  - [Aspose.Slides Java for PHP](https://github.com/aspose-slides/Aspose.Slides-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Slides_Java_for_PHP)
### **How to configure the source code on Linux Platform**
Please follow these simple steps in order to open and extend the source code while using:
### **1. Install Tomcat Server**
To install tomcat server, issue following command on the linux console. This will successfully install tomcat server. 

```

 sudo apt-get install tomcat8

```
### **2. Download and Configure PHP/JavaBridge**
In order to download the PHP/JavaBridge binaries, issue following command on the linux console. 

```

  wget http://citylan.dl.sourceforge.net/project/php-java-bridge/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip 

```


Unzip the PHP/JavaBridge binaries by issuing the following command on linux console. 

```

  unzip -d php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip 

```


This will extract **JavaBridge.war** file. Copy it to tomcat88 **webapps** folder by issuing the following command on Linux console. 

```

  sudo cp JavaBridge.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/JavaBridge.war 

```


By copying, tomcat8 will automatically create a new folder "**JavaBridge**" in **webapps**. Once the folder is created, make sure your tomcat8 is running and then check <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge> in browser, it should open a default page of JavaBridge. 

If any error message appears then install  **FastCGI** by issuing the following command on Linux console.

```

  sudo apt-get install php55-cgi 

```

After installing php5.5 cgi, restart tomcat8 server and check <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge> again in the browser.

If **JAVA_HOME** error is displayed, then open /etc/default/tomcat8 file and uncomment the line that sets the JAVA_HOME. Check <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge> in browser again, it should come with PHP/JavaBridge Examples page. 
### **3. Configure Aspose.Slides Java for PHP Examples**
Clone, PHP examples by issuing the following commands inside webapps/JavaBridge folder.  

```

 $ git init&nbsp;

$ git clone [https://github.com/aspose-slides/Aspose.Slides-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Slides_Java_for_PHP] 

```

### **How to configure the source code on Windows Platform**
Please follow below simple steps to configure PHP/Java Bridge on Windows Platform

1. Install PHP5 and configure as you normally do
2. Install JRE 6 (Java Runtime Environment) if you don’t already have it. You can check this in C:\Program Files etc. You can download it here . I am using JRE 6 as It is compatible with PHP Java Bridge (PJB).

3. Install Apache Tomcat 8.0. You can download it here

4.Download [JavaBridge.war](http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/JavaBridgeTemplate621.war/download). Copy this file to tomcat webapps directory.
(ex: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps )

5. Restart tomcat apache service.

6.Go to <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/test.php> to check if php works. You can find other examples in there

7.Copy your [Aspose.Slides Java](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.slides-for-java/default.aspx) jar file to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\WEB-INF\lib

8. Clone [Aspose.Slides Java for PHP](https://github.com/aspose-slides/Aspose.Slides-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Slides_Java_for_PHP) examples inside C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\ folder.

8. Copy folder C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\java to your Aspose.Slides Java for PHP examples folder.

10. Restart apache tomcat service and start using examples.
