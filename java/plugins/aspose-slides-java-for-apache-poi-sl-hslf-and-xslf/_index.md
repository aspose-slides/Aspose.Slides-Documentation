## **Introduction**
### **Apache POI - HSLF and XSLF**
**HSLF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Powerpoint '97(-2007) file format.

HSLF provides a way to read, create or modify PowerPoint presentations. In particular, it provides:

- api for data extraction (text, pictures, embedded objects, sounds)
- usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying ppt files

**XSLF** is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the PowerPoint 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file format.

Whilst HSLF and XSLF provide similar features, there is not a common interface across the two of them at this time.

### **Aspose.Slides for Java**
Aspose.Slides for Java is a unique PowerPoint management component that enables Java applications to read, write and manipulate PowerPoint documents (PPT, PPTX, POS, PPS, POTX, PPSX) PDF, HTML and image file formats without using Microsoft PowerPoint.

Aspose.Slides for Java is the first and only Java component that provides functionality to manage PowerPoint documents within your own applications.

As with all Aspose Java components, Aspose.Slides for Java is written in pure Java, incredibly priced and lightning fast.
