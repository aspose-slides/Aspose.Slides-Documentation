## **Aspose.Slides - New Presentation**
The [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) class holds a presentation's content. Whether creating a presentation from scratch or modifying an existing one, when finished, you want to save the presentation. With Aspose.Slides for Java, it can be saved as a **file** or **stream**.

```java
//Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file
Presentation pres = new Presentation();

//Writing the presentation as a PPT file
pres.write("NewPPT_Aspose.ppt");
```

## **Apache POI SL - HSLF XSLF - New Presentation**

//create a new empty slide show
SlideShow ppt = new SlideShow();

//add first slide
Slide s1 = ppt.createSlide();

//save changes in a file
FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("NewPPT_Apache.ppt");
ppt.write(out);
out.close();
