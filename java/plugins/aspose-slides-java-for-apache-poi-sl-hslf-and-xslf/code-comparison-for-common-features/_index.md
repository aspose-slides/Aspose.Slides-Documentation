The developers looking for presentation processing libraries may need to walk through the features provided by the libraries available on the market. Mainly, few factors are considered when choosing an option:

- Features
- Efforts required to use the library
- Performance

If you are a Java developer looking to choose a presentation and slides processing library to process presentations, you may want to compare Apache POI SL - HSLF and XSLF SDK with Aspose.Slides. In this case, this very project will help you to compare features and code using both the libraries.
