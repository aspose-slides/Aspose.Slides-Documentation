This article describes a licensing bug encountered in Aspose.Slides for Java versions 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6 and 23.7. This bug caused perpetual licenses to become temporarily unusable after their subscription expired.

## Symptoms ##

After your perpetual license subscription expires, Aspose.Slides for Java versions 23.2 - 23.7 may report the license as expired, transitioning all functions into a evaluation mode.
This behavior is incorrect and does not affect versions prior to 23.2 and after 23.7.
