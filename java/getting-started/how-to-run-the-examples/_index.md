## **Adding Aspose.Slides Library into Maven Local Repository**
When you import **Aspose.Slides Examples** project into IDE, Maven automatically downloads aspose.slides JAR file from [Aspose Maven Repository](http://maven.aspose.com/repository/simple/ext-release-local/com/aspose/). In case you do not have access to internet, you can manually add JAR in your local repository.

### **mvn install**
Download the [aspose.slides](http://maven.aspose.com/repository/simple/ext-release-local/com/aspose/aspose-slides/), extract it and copy the aspose.slides-version.jar to somewhere else, for example, c drive. Issue following command:

```
mvn install:install-file
    -Dfile=c:\aspose.slides-version.jar
    -DgroupId=com.aspose
    -DartifactId=aspose-slides
    -Dversion={version}
    -Dpackaging=jar
```

Now, the **aspose.slides** jar is copied to your Maven local repository.

### **pom.xml**
After installed, just declares the **aspose.slides** coordinate in pom.xml. Add following repository in repositories tab and dependency in dependencies tab.

``` xml
<repository>
    <id>aspose-maven-repository</id>
    <url>http://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
    <version>18.6</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### **Done**
Build it, now the **aspose.slides** jar is able to retrieve from your Maven local repository.
