## **Installing Aspose.Slides for Java from Maven Repository**

### **Specify Maven Repository Configuration**
First, you need to specify Aspose Maven Repository configuration / location in your Maven pom.xml as follows:

``` xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>
        <name>Aspose Java API</name>
        <url>https://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
### **Define Aspose.Slides for Java API Dependency**
Then define Aspose.Slides for Java API dependency in your pom.xml as follows:

``` xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
        <version>20.1</version>
        <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
        <version>20.1</version>
        <classifier>javadoc</classifier>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

After performing the above steps, Aspose.Slides for Java dependency will finally be defined in your Maven Project.
