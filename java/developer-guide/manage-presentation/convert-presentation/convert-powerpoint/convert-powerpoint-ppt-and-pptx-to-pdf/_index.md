Aspose.Slides for Java directly writes the information about API and Version Number in output documents. For example, upon rendering Document to [PDF](https://wiki.fileformat.com/view/pdf/), Aspose.Slides for Java populates the Application field with value 'Aspose.Slides' and PDF Producer field with value, e.g 'Aspose.Slides v 17.10'.

Please note that you cannot instruct Aspose.Slides for Java to change or remove this information from output Documents.

It's a popular format so developers are often asked to convert Microsoft PowerPoint presentation files to PDF documents. Realizing this possible requirement, Aspose.Slides for Java supports converting presentations to PDF documents without using any other component. This topic illustrates how this conversion can be done.

Aspose.Slides for Java offers the 
[Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/presentation) class that represents a presentation file. The [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/presentation) class exposes the **Save** method that can be called to convert the whole presentation into a PDF document. The [PdfOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/PdfOptions) class provides options for creating the PDF such as **JpegQuality**, **TextCompression**, **Compliance** and others. These options can be used to get the desired standard of PDF.

## **Convert PPT(X) to PDF using Default Options**
The following example shows how to convert a presentation into a PDF document using the default options. The default options create a PDF document of maximum quality.
