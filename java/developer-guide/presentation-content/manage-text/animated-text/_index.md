## Adding Animation Effects to Paragraphs

We added the [**addEffect()**](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Sequence#addEffect-com.aspose.slides.IParagraph-int-int-int-) method to the [**Sequence**](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Sequence) and [**ISequence**](https://apireference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/ISequence) classes. This method allows you to add animation effects to a single paragraph. This sample code shows you how to add an animation effect to a single paragraph:

```java
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("Presentation.pptx");
try {
    // select paragraph to add effect
    IAutoShape autoShape = (IAutoShape)presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);
    IParagraph paragraph = autoShape.getTextFrame().getParagraphs().get_Item(0);

    // add Fly animation effect to selected paragraph
    IEffect effect = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0).getTimeline().getMainSequence().
            addEffect(paragraph, EffectType.Fly, EffectSubtype.Left, EffectTriggerType.OnClick);

    presentation.save("AnimationEffectinParagraph.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
}
```

## Getting the Animation Effects in Paragraphs

You may decide to find out the animation effects added to a paragraphâ€”for example, in one scenario, you want to get the animation effects in a paragraph because you plan to apply those effects to another paragraph or shape.

Aspose.Slides for Java allows you to get all the animation effects applied to paragraphs contained in a text frame (shape). This sample code shows you how to get the animation effects in a paragraph:

```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation("Presentation.pptx");
try {
    ISequence sequence = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getTimeline().getMainSequence();
    IAutoShape autoShape = (IAutoShape)pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);

    for (IParagraph paragraph : autoShape.getTextFrame().getParagraphs())
    {
        IEffect[] effects = sequence.getEffectsByParagraph(paragraph);

        if (effects.length > 0)
            System.out.println("Paragraph \"" + paragraph.getText() + "\" has " + effects[0].getType() + " effect.");
    }
} finally {
    pres.dispose();
}
```
