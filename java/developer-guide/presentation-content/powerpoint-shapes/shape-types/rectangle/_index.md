## **Add Rectangle to Slide**
To add a simple rectangle to a selected slide of the presentation, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Add an IAutoShape of Rectangle type using AddAutoShape method exposed by IShapes object.
- Write the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

In the example given below, we have added a simple rectangle to the first slide of the presentation.

- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Add an IAutoShape of Rectangle type using AddAutoShape method exposed by IShapes object.
- Set the Fill Type of the Rectangle to Solid.
- Set the Color of the Rectangle using SolidFillColor.Color property as exposed by FillFormat object associated with the IShape object.
- Set the Color of the lines of the Rectangle.
- Set the Width of the lines of the Rectangle.
- Write the modified presentation as PPTX file.

The above steps are implemented in the example given below.
