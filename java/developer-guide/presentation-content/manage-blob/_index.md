## **Export BLOB from Presentations**
Aspose.Slides for Java provides a facility to Export large files (audio and video file in that case). We want to extract these files from the presentation and do not want to load this presentation into memory to keep our memory consumption low. Here is an example is given below how we can export BLOB from presentations in Java.

## **Add Image as BLOB to Presentation**
Aspose.Slides for Java added a new method to [**IImageCollection**](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/IImageCollection) interface and [**ImageCollection**](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/ImageCollection) class to support adding a large images as streams to treat them as BLOBs.

This example demonstrates how to include the large BLOB (image) and prevent a high memory consumption.
