## **Set InvertIfNegative Property of Chart Series**
The Aspose.Slides for Java lets developers allow to set inverts. **IChartDataPoint.InvertIfNegative** and **ChartDataPoint.InvertIfNegative** properties have been added. This Specifies the data point shall invert its colors if the value is negative. Sample code is given below.

Aspose.Slides for Java lets developers set chart series overlap for chart series in chart series collection. This article explains how to set the chart series overlap values for chart series.

{{% /alert %}} 

Aspose.Slides for Java provides an API to set chart series overlap. The [IChartSeries.setOverlap()](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/interfaces/IChartSeries) method specifies how much bars and columns should overlap on 2D charts (in a range from -100 to 100). This property is not only for the referred series but for all series of the parent series group: this is projection of the appropriate group property. Therefore, this property is read-only.

Use the **ParentSeriesGroup** property to access the parent series group, and then access the **ParentSeriesGroup.setOverlap()** read/write property to change the value.

1. Create an instance of the [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
1. Add a clustered column chart on a slide.
1. Access the first chart series.
1. Access the selected series **ParentSeriesGroup** and set the chart series overlap value.
1. Write the modified presentation to a PPTX file.
