## **Create a table from scratch in a slide**
{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Aspose.Slides for Java facilitates developers to add custom tables in their slides from scratch. This is one of the newest features added in Aspose.Slides for Java since last few versions. In this topic, we will explain how developers can create and add tables to their slides using Aspose.Slides for Java.

### **Create a table from scratch**
Aspose.Slides for Java has provided the simplest API to create tables. To create a table in a slide and perform some basic operations on the table, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Create an Array of Columns' Width.
- Create an Array of Rows' Height.
- Add a Table to the slide using **addTable** method exposed by [ISlideCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/interfaces/ISlideCollection) object.
- Iterate through each Cell to apply formatting to the Top, Bottom, Right and Left Borders.
- Merge first two cells of the first row of the table.
- Access the Text Frame of a Cell.
- Add some text to the Text Frame.
- Save the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

### **Enable/Disable the first row as header**
Aspose.Slides for Java provides the feature to enable/disable the first row as header using the following methods of [ITable](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/interfaces/ITable) interface:

### **Remove borders of a table's cells.**
To remove borders of the table cells, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Create an Array of Columns' Width.
- Create an Array of Rows' Height.
- Add a Table to the slide using **addTable** method exposed by [ISlideCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/interfaces/ISlideCollection) object.
- Iterate through each Cell to clear the Top, Bottom, Right and Left Borders.
- Save the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

### **Identify merge Table Cell**
Aspose.Slides for Java has provided the simplest API to identify merge table cells in an easiest way. To identify merge cells in table, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/slides/aspose.slides/presentation) class.
- Obtain the the table from first slide.
- Iterate through row and columns of table to find out merge cells.
- Print Message if cells are merged.

## **Access an existing table in a slide**
{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Aspose.Slides for Java allows developers to not only add custom tables in their slides but also access or manage the existing ones. In this topic, we will discuss about accessing a table that already exists in a slide.

{{% /alert %}} 

To access a table that already exists in a slide, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide (that contains the table) by using its Position.
- Create an [ITable](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/interfaces/ITable) object and set it to null.
- Iterate through all Shapes until you find the Table. If a slide contains only one table then you can simply check a shape and if it is found to be a Table then just typecast it as a Table object. But, if the slide contains more than one tables then it is better to find your desired table using its Alternative Text.
- After the Table is found, you can use [ITable](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/interfaces/ITable) object to control the table. For example, in our case, we have added a new row in the desired table.
- Save the modified presentation as a PPTX file.
