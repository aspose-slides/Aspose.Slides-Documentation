While effects in PowerPoint can be used to make a shape stand out, they differ from [fills](/slides/python-net/shape-formatting/#gradient-fill) or outlines. Using PowerPoint effects, you can create convincing reflections on a shape, spread a shape's glow, etc.

* PowerPoint provides six effects that can be applied to shapes. You can apply one or more effects to a shape. 

* Some combinations of effects look better than others. For this reason, PowerPoint options under **Preset**. The Preset options are essentially a known good-looking combination of two or more effects. This way, by selecting a preset, you won't have to waste time testing or combining different effects to find a nice combination.

Aspose.Slides provides properties and methods under the [EffectFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/effectformat/) class that allow you to apply the same effects to shapes in PowerPoint presentations.
