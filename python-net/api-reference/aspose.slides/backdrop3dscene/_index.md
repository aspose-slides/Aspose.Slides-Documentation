The Backdrop3DScene type exposes the following members:
## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|as_ipresentation_component|Allows to get base IPresentationComponent interface.<br/>            Read-only [IPresentationComponent](/slides/python-net/api-reference/aspose.slides/ipresentationcomponent/).|
|normal_vector|Returns or sets a normal vector. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector<br/>            normal to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values<br/>            which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write|
|anchor_point|Returns or sets a point in 3D space. This point is the point in space that anchors the backdrop plane.<br/>            3D point represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write|
|up_vector|Returns or sets a vector representing up. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector<br/>            representing up in relation to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array<br/>            of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write|
|slide|Returns the base slide.<br/>            Read-only [IBaseSlide](/slides/python-net/api-reference/aspose.slides/ibaseslide/).|
