## IBackdrop3DScene class

Defines a plane in which effects, such as glow and shadow, are applied in relation to the shape they are being applied to.

The IBackdrop3DScene type exposes the following members:
## Properties
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|normal_vector|Returns or sets a normal vector. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector<br/>            normal to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array of 3 float values<br/>            which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write|
|anchor_point|Returns or sets a point in 3D space. This point is the point in space that anchors the backdrop plane.<br/>            3D point represented by array of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write|
|up_vector|Returns or sets a vector representing up. To be more precise, this attribute defines a vector<br/>            representing up in relation to the face of the backdrop plane. Vector represented by array<br/>            of 3 float values which define X, Y and Z coordinates.<br/>            Read/write|
