## ITiming class

Represents animation timing.

The ITiming type exposes the following members:
## Properties
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
|accelerate|Describes the percentage of duration accelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write|
|decelerate|Describes the percentage of duration decelerate behavior effect.<br/>            Read/write|
|auto_reverse|Describes whether to automatically play the animation in reverse after<br/>            playing it in the forward direction.<br/>            Read/write bool.|
|duration|Describes the duration of animation effect.<br/>            Read/write|
|repeat_count|Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write|
|repeat_duration|Describes the number of times the effect should repeat.<br/>            Read/write|
|restart|Specifies if a effect is to restart after complete.<br/>            Read/write [EffectRestartType](/slides/python-net/api-reference/aspose.slides.animation/effectrestarttype/).|
|speed|Specifies the percentage by which to speed up (or slow down) the timing.<br/>            Read/write|
|trigger_delay_time|Describes delay time after trigger.<br/>            Read/write|
