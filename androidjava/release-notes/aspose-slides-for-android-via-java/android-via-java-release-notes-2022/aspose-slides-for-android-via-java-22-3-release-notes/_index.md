## **Public API Changes**

### AutoShape.isTextBox method was added

[AutoShape.isTextBox](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/AutoShape#isTextBox--) method was added to indicate if the shape was created as a text box or not. The screenshot below demonstrates two scenarios when a shape will be created as a text box and a regular shape:

![Text box and shape](istextbox.png)

This code snippet demonstrates iteration over all [Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/Presentation) shapes and out to console if the shape is a text box or not (if the shape is [AutoShape](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/androidjava/com.aspose.slides/AutoShape)).

``` java
Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx");
try {
    ForEach.shape(pres, (shape, slide, index) ->
    {
        if (shape instanceof AutoShape)
        {
            AutoShape autoShape = (AutoShape)shape;
            System.out.println(autoShape.isTextBox() ? "shape is text box" : "shape is text not box");
        }
    });
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

### Classes inherited from EffectEffectiveData removed from public API

The follwoing classes that inherited from EffectEffectiveData were removed from the public API:

* AlphaBiLevelEffectiveData
* AlphaModulateFixedEffectiveData
* AlphaReplaceEffectiveData
* BiLevelEffectiveData
* BlurEffectiveData
* ColorChangeEffectiveData
* ColorReplaceEffectiveData
* DuotoneEffectiveData
* FillOverlayEffectiveData
* GlowEffectiveData
* HSLEffectiveData
* InnerShadowEffectiveData
* LuminanceEffectiveData
* OuterShadowEffectiveData
* PresetShadowEffectiveData
* ReflectionEffectiveData
* SoftEdgeEffectiveData
* TintEffectiveData

All effective values are still available via corresponding public interfaces, e.g.:

``` java
Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx");
try {
    ForEach.portion(pres, (portion, para, slide, index) ->
    {
        IPortionFormatEffectiveData effective = portion.getPortionFormat().getEffective();
    });
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
