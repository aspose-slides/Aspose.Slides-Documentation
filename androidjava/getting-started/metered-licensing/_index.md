Aspose.Slides allows developers to apply metered key. It is a new licensing mechanism. The new licensing mechanism will be used alongside existing license methods. Customers, who prefer to be billed based on their usage of API features, can use the metered licensing.Â For more details, please refer to [Metered Licensing FAQ](https://purchase.aspose.com/faqs/licensing/metered) section.

## **Metered Licensing**
Follow these simple steps to use the Metered class:

1. Create an instance of Metered class.

1. Pass public & private keys to setMeteredKey method.

1. Do processing (perform the task).

1. Call the method getConsumptionQuantity of the Metered class.

   It will return the amount/quantity of API requests you have consumed so far.

This sample code shows you how to set metered public and private keys:

```java
com.aspose.slides.Metered metered=new com.aspose.slides.Metered();
try {
    // Access the setMeteredKey property and pass public and private keys as parameters
    metered.setMeteredKey("<valid pablic key>", "<valid private key>");

    // Get consumed qantity value before accessing API
    double quantityOld = com.aspose.slides.Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();
    System.out.println("Consumption quantity" + quantityOld);


    // Get consumed qantity value after accessing API
    double quantity = com.aspose.slides.Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();
    System.out.println("Consumption quantity" + quantity);


} catch (Exception ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```
