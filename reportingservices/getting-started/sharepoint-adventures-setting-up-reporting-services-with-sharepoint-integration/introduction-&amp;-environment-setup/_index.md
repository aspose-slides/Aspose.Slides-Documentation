There have been inquires in past regarding Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services Integration with SharePoint. In this article, we will be focusing on SharePoint 2010. It is assumed that one already have a SharePoint Farm environment setup. The examples that we will be following in this article will be a full SharePoint Cloud, but the steps will be similar for a SharePoint Foundation Server. Before we proceed, let start with some key documentation that you can use for reference when you do this: 

- [Overview of Reporting Services and SharePoint Technology Integration](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb326358.aspx)  
- [Deployment Topologies for Reporting Services in SharePoint Integrated Mode ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510781.aspx) 
- [Configuring Reporting Services for SharePoint 2010 Integration ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb326356.aspx)

#### **Environment Setup**
The setup that we will be having consists of **4 servers**. That includes a **Domain Controller**, a **SQL Server**, a **SharePoint Server** and a server for **Reporting Services**. You may opt to have SharePoint and Reporting Services on the same box.
