You only need to follow these steps if you install Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services manually, not using the MSI installer. The MSI installer performs all necessary installation and registration actions automatically. 

{{% /alert %}} 

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}} 

**Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services** requires the installation of **.NET Framework 3.5** on the host machine. 

{{% /alert %}}

### **Manual Installation**
In the following steps, you will need to copy and modify files in the directory where Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services is installed. 

1. Locate the Report Server installation directory.
   The root directory for Microsoft SQL Server is usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server. {{% alert color="primary" %}} 

**Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008**: There could be several instances of Microsoft SQL Server configured on the machine and they occupy different MSSQL.x subdirectories such as MSSQL.1, MSSQL.2 and so on. Find the correct **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.x\Reporting Services\ReportServer** directory before proceeding.

{{% /alert %}} All paths used below will refer to this directory as <Instance>. 

2. Copy Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll to **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\ <Instance> \Reporting Services\ReportServer\bin** folder.
   The **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.zip** download contains the **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll** and compiled documentation in CHM format. {{% alert color="primary" %}} 

In some cases, when you copy the DLL to the **ReportServer\bin** directory, it might get copied together with the explicit NTFS file permissions assigned to it. The NTFS permissions might be such that Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services is denied access when loading **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll**. If this happens, the new export formats do not become available. To make sure that the NTFS permissions are correct:

   1. Right click **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll**.
   1. Click **Properties** and select the **Security** tab.
   1. Remove any explicitly assigned NTFS permissions and leave only inherited permissions.

3. Register Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services as a rendering extension: 
   1. Open *C:\Program
      Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<Instance>\Reporting Services\ReportServer\rsreportserver.config*.
   1. Add the following lines into the <Render> element: 

**<Render>**

``` xml

   ...

  <!--Start here.-->

  <Extension Name="ASPPT" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PptRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <Extension Name="ASPPS" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PpsRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <Extension Name="ASPPTX" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PptxRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <Extension Name="ASPPSX" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PpsxRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <!--End here.-->

</Render>



```

4. Give Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services permissions to execute: 
   1. Open **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<Instance>\Reporting Services\ReportServer\rssrvpolicy.config**.
   1. Add the following as the last item in the second to outer <CodeGroup> element (which should be <CodeGroup class="FirstMatchCodeGroup" version="1" PermissionSetName="Execution" Description="This code group grants MyComputer code Execution permission. ">). 

**<CodeGroup>**

``` xml



...

  <CodeGroup>

    ...

    <!--Start here.-->

    <CodeGroup

        class="UnionCodeGroup"

        version="1"

        PermissionSetName="FullTrust"

        Name="Aspose.Slides_for_Reporting_Services"

        Description="This code group grants full trust to the AS4SSRS assembly.">

        <IMembershipCondition

            class="StrongNameMembershipCondition"

            version="1"

            PublicKeyBlob="00240000048000009400000006020000002400005253413100040000010001005542e

    </CodeGroup>

    <!--End here.-->
