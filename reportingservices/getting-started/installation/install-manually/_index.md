Follow these steps only if plan to install Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services manually. In this case, you downloaded the ZIP package containing assembly files. 

{{% /alert %}} 

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}} 

**Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services** requires the installation of **.NET Framework 3.5** on the host machine. 

{{% /alert %}}

### **Manual Installation**
These instructions show you how to copy and modify files in the directory where Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services is installed:

1. Locate the Report Server installation directory.
   The root directory for Microsoft SQL Server is usually here: ***C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server***
   
   {{% alert color="primary" %}} 
   
   **Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008**: There might be several Microsoft SQL Server instances configured on the machine and they may occupy different MSSQL.x subdirectories such as MSSQL.1, MSSQL.2 and so on. You must find the correct ***C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.x\Reporting Services\ReportServer*** directory before you continue to the next step.
   
   {{% /alert %}} All paths used below will refer to this directory as <Instance>. 

2. Copy Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll to the **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\xxx\Reporting Services\ReportServer\bin** folder.
   The **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.zip** download contains the **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll**. {{% alert color="primary" %}} 

In some cases, when you copy the DLL to the **ReportServer\bin** directory, it might get copied alongside the explicit NTFS file permissions assigned to it. The NTFS permissions cause Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services to get denied access when loading **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll**. If this happens, the new export formats will not become available. Check and confirm that the correct NTFS permissions are in place :

   1. Right-click **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll**.
   1. Click **Properties** and select the **Security** tab.
   1. Remove any explicitly assigned NTFS permissions and leave only inherited permissions.

{{% /alert %}}

3. Register Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services as a rendering extension: 
   1. Open *C:\Program
      Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<Instance>\Reporting Services\ReportServer\rsreportserver.config*.
   1. Add these lines to the <Render> element: 

**<Render>**

``` xml

   ...

  <!--Start here.-->

  <Extension Name="ASPPT" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PptRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <Extension Name="ASPPS" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PpsRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <Extension Name="ASPPTX" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PptxRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <Extension Name="ASPPSX" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PpsxRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

  <!--End here.-->

</Render>



```

4. Give Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services permissions to execute: 
   1. Open **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<Instance>\Reporting Services\ReportServer\rssrvpolicy.config**.
   1. Add the following as the last item in the second to outer <CodeGroup> element (which should be <CodeGroup class="FirstMatchCodeGroup" version="1" PermissionSetName="Execution" Description="This code group grants MyComputer code Execution permission. ">). 

**<CodeGroup>**

``` xml



...

  <CodeGroup>

    ...

    <!--Start here.-->

    <CodeGroup

        class="UnionCodeGroup"

        version="1"

        PermissionSetName="FullTrust"

        Name="Aspose.Slides_for_Reporting_Services"
