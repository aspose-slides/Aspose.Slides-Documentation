## **Steps of Re-installing Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services**
T he most important point to consider is to remove the previous Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services installations completely. Although, the MSI installer can successfully perform the necessary actions required to uninstall and hence reinstall Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services automatically, yet the following checklist of steps will ensure to achieve the desired results: 

**Step** **1:** Uninstall Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services using MSI installer. 


**Step** **2:** Locate Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services installation directory which is typically located at: 

**OS Root Drive\Program Files\Aspose\Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services** 


**Step** **3:** If MSI installer has not removed “Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services” directory while uninstalling Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services, just delete it. 


**Step** **4:** Locate **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll** binary in “bin” directory of each SQL Server Reporting Service instance. For example, if there is a Microsoft SQL Server 2008 instance “MSSQLSERVER”, the corresponding Reporting Service “bin” directory will be typically located at: 

**OS Root Drive\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportServer\bin** 


**Step** **5:** If MSI installer has not removed Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll binary file from the above directory while uninstalling Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services, just delete this file. 


**Step** **6:** Locate **rsreportserver.config** file for each SSRS instance. For example, if there is a Reporting Ser vice instance “ **MSRS10.MSSQLSERVER** ”, the **rsreportserver.config** file will be in the following directory: 

**MSRS10.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportServer** 


**Step** **7:** Open **rsreportserver.config** file in some editor and locate the following lines that were created in order to add PowerPoint Formats Extensions during the installation of Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services. 

``` xml

 <Extension Name="ASPPT" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PptRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

<Extension Name="ASPPS" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PpsRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

<Extension Name="ASPPTX" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PptxRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>

<Extension Name="ASPPSX" Type="Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.PpsxRenderer,Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices"/>



```

**Step** **8:** If MSI installer has not removed the above lines while uninstalling Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services, just delete these lines from **rsreportserver.config** file. 


**Step** **9:** Locate **rssrvpolicy.config** file for each SSRS instance. For examp le, if there is a Reporting Ser vice instance “ MSRS10.MSSQLSERVER ”, the **rssrvpolicy.config** file will be in the following directory: 

**MSRS10.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportServer** 


**Step** **10:** Open **rssrvpolicy.config** file in some editor and locate the following lines that were created in order to grant execution permissions to Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services during the installation of Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

    <!--End here.-->

</CodeGroup>



```

**Step** **11:** If MSI installer has not removed the above lines while uninstalling Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services, just remove these lines from **rssrvpolicy.config** file. 


**Step** **12:** If Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services was also installed with Microsoft Visual Studio for RDL report development and export to PowerPoint Formats within Microsoft Visual Studio environment: the binary file Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll and configuration files ( **rsreportserver.config** and **rssrvpolicy.config** ) in case of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 will be typically located at: 

**OS Root Drive\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies** 


**Step** **13:** If MSI installer has not removed the **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll** binary, delete it. Moreover, if it has not updated the **rsreportserver.config** and **rssrvpolicy.config** files to remove PowerPoint Format Extensions and code execution permissions respectively, remove them manually in the same way as explained in the previous steps. 


**Step** **14:** Now, it is time to re-install the Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services. This can be done either through MSI installer or manually as explained in the previous sections.
