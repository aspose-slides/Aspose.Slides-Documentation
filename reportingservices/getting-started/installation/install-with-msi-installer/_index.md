## **Installation**
You can install Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services by using an MSI installer. 

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}} 

**Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services** requires the installation of **.NET Framework 3.5** on the host machine. 

{{% /alert %}}

Run ***Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.msi*** and follow the steps offered by the installer. The installer will copy the assembly and other files to the specified directory and install the product on the default instance of Reporting Services. You do not need to copy or modify any files manually unless you want to ad d special configuration parameters. 

Using the MSI installer is the best option that works in most cases. However, you may want to install the product manually in some situations like the following: 

- Automatic installation fails due to some reason such as security issues.
- You need to install the product on a named (not default) instance of Reporting Services or on multiple instances.
- You upgrade to the latest version and just want to replace the assembly instead of uninstalling the old version and installing the new one using MSI installer. Note however that in this case you may end up with other files (such as the offline documentation) not upgraded.
