## **License support**
{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

You can download an evaluation version of **Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services** from [its Releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/reportingservices/). The evaluation version provides the same functionalities as the licensed version of the product. The evaluation package is the same as the purchased package. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed after you add a few lines of code to it (to apply the license).

Once you are happy with your evaluation of the product, you can [purchase a license](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). We recommend you go through the different subscription types. If you have questions, contact the Aspose sales team.

## **Licensing in Aspose.Slides for Reporting Service**

* An evaluation version becomes licensed after you purchase a license and add a couple of lines of code to it (to apply the license).
* The license is a plain-text XML file that contains details such as the product name, the number of developers it is licensed to, the subscription expiry date, and so on. 
* The license file is digitally signed, so you must not modify the file. Even an inadvertent addition of an extra line break to the contents of the file will invalidate it.
* To avoid the limitations associated with the evaluation version, you need to set a license before using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Service. 

Download the license to your computer and copy it to the **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<Instance>\Reporting Services\ReportServer\bin** folder, which is where **Aspose.Slides.ReportingServices.dll** is installed. 

To confirm that the license was installed correctly, export any report as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. If the document does not contain a watermark, the license was activated successfully.

**Evaluation Mode**
